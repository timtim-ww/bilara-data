  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc41:2.1.14": "The usual meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇī</i> as “lotus pond” is well established in the suttas. Much of the time they seem to have been decorative, but there are few instances in the Vinaya where they are used for washing, such as in Mahā-khandhaka where the Buddha washes a cloth in a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇī</i> (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#20.1.4'>Kd 1:20.1.4</a>). In fact, this distinction in use is reflected in the commentaries, which speak of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nahāna-pokkharaṇī</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇi</i> for bathing”, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kīḷana-pokkharaṇi</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇi</i> for playing”. Because <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇis</i> were given to monasteries “for the benefit of the Sangha” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.1'>Kd 15:17.2.1</a>), they were probably meant for bathing and washing, not just for decoration. Moreover, it seems the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pokkharaṇis</i> could be quite elaborate structures with foundations, staircases, and rails (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.6'>Kd 15:17.2.1</a>). For these reasons I vary my translation according to context, sometimes using “pond”, at other times “tank”, and sometimes adding the qualifier “lotus”. "
