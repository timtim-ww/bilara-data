  "an8.62:6.6": "This passage shows the rather annoying ambivalence in sequence of _attha_ and _dhamma_. When _dhamma_ comes first, we want to translate it as “teaching”, then _attha_ becomes “meaning (of the teaching)”. But this seems strange if _attha_ comes first. Then, we would naturally expect that _attha_ is “matter, substance, content (of the teaching)”, and _dhamma_ is the “principle”, i.e. how it fits into the four noble truths. ",
  "an8.62:7.5": "In BB’s translation, this pair of statements contradict each other. He “is not capable” of remembering, yet he examines what he has remembered. I think the text is not actually contradictory. We should read -jatika as meaning “natural-born, talented”, and translate as “readily memorize”. Thus someone who is not a natural memorizer, even though it’s hard for them to memorize things, still manage to remember some things (Culapanthaka!), and these are what they examine. "
