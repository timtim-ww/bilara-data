<p>The present volume is the first of six, the total of which constitutes a complete translation of the Pali Vinaya Piṭaka, the Monastic Law, of the Theravada school of Buddhism. For a general overview of the Monastic Law, see the General Introduction above. In the present introduction, I will survey the contents of volume 1 and make observations of points of particular interest.</p>
<p>The first part of the Vinaya Piṭaka is known as the Sutta-vibhaṅga, which can be rendered as the Analysis of the Sutta. In this context the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> does not mean a discourse of the Buddha, but refers to the Pātimokkha, the Monastic Code, which consists of the rules of conduct that form the kernel of the Sutta-vibhaṅga.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a> The Sutta-vibhaṅga, then, is the analysis of the rules of the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>Because there are two Pātimokkhas, the Sutta-vibhaṅga is divided into two principal parts, the Bhikkhu-vibhaṅga and the Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga, the Monks’ Analysis and the Nuns’ Analysis.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a> The Monks’ Analysis is also known as the Mahā-vibhaṅga, the Great Analysis. In the present introduction, I will focus on the first part of the monks’ Pātimokkha and its Analysis, specifically the first three classes of rules, known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aniyatas</i>, the meanings of which I will give shortly. I will also discuss some general themes. The remaining monks’ rules will be treated in a separate introduction to volume 2, while the nuns’ rules will feature in volume 3.</p>
<p>The monks’ Pātimokkha consists of 227 rules that are divided into eight classes, presented in what may be considered as a descending order of importance. In brief, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i> (Pj), “the offenses entailing expulsion”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i> (Ss), “the offenses entailing suspension”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aniyatas</i> (Ay), “the indeterminate offenses”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> (NP), “the offenses entailing relinquishment and confession”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> (Pc), “the offenses entailing confession”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i> (Pd), “the offenses entailing acknowledgment”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> (Sk), “the rules of training”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i>, or just <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> (As), “the principles for settling legal issues”.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-historical-development-of-the-pātimokkha">The historical development of the Pātimokkha</h2>
<p>In what follows, I will briefly discuss the historical development of these rules. A good place to start is with W. Pachow’s Comparative Study of the Prātimokṣa.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a> In this ground-breaking study, Pachow compares all existing versions of the Pātimokkha, altogether ten recensions coming from seven different schools of early Buddhism. One of his interesting discoveries is that the rules, both in number and in wording, are very closely related to each other, with the exception of the second last class, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>. If we leave these aside, it is obvious that the Pātimokkha rules hark back to a common ancestor that must have existed before the separate schools of Buddhism started to emerge. And given the conservatism of Buddhism, which seems to be a result of the Buddha’s explicit instructions, it seems plausible that this common core goes back to the Buddha himself.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-4' id='introduction-noteref-4' role='doc-noteref'>4</a></p>
<p>As to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules, there is significant variation between the different schools. The number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> varies from 66 in the Mahāsāṅghika recension to 113 for the Sarvāstivādins. Further, the order of the rules is often very different in the different schools. Yet, as can be seen from Pachow’s concordance tables, 28 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> are found in almost identical form across the various schools, a number that increases to 45 if we disregard cases where only a single school is missing a rule.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-5' id='introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-noteref'>5</a> From this we can conclude that even the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>, as a class, must have existed in the earliest period. We are left with a picture of the earliest Pātimokkha, presumably as laid down by the Buddha, as consisting of all the classes we have today, with the only significant difference being the number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules.</p>
<p>Let us now take a closer look at the Pali tradition. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the Numerical Discourses, we find a few <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i>, namely, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.84/en/sujato">AN 3.84</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.86/en/sujato">AN 3.86</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.87/en/sujato">AN 3.87</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.88/en/sujato">AN 3.88</a>, that speak of “over a hundred and fifty training rules”. Clearly this must refer to a time when the Pātimokkha was shorter than it is now. The fact that all four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i> speak of over 150 training rules, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sikkhāpadas</i>, may suggest that this was the number reached while the Buddha was still alive. It is also possible that the number is deliberately round because the rules were still being added to. Still, given that the text uses the number 150, it seems reasonable to assume that the number was significantly less than 200. So, what might these 150+ rules have been?</p>
<p>To start with, we can exclude the last seven rules, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr10/en/brahmali#38.1">Pvr 10:38.1</a>–38.5 states that the monks had 220 training rules, while the nuns had 304, which means the last seven rules are not counted. This makes sense for they are not “training rules”, but rather broader principles for dealing with Sangha “issues”. This, however, does not mean that the seven were not originally part of the Pātimokkha, as suggested by Bhikkhu Nyanatusita and K. R. Norman.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-6' id='introduction-noteref-6' role='doc-noteref'>6</a> The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> are found in all the early Buddhist schools, and even the order of rules is largely the same. This makes it likely that these rules were there from earliest times. Nevertheless, it is unexpected to find such rules in the Pātimokkha, a state of affairs I will discuss further below.</p>
<p>Second, based on the findings of Pachow discussed above, we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the discrepancy is to be found among the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>. If we remove the class of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> offenses as a whole, however, as suggested by some,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-7' id='introduction-noteref-7' role='doc-noteref'>7</a> the total number of rules is reduced to 145, which is too low. We must therefore conclude, once again, that some of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> go back to the earliest period. Nonetheless, it is clearly the other classes of rules that form the core of the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to say what may have been the earliest training rules. The early Pātimokkha had in excess of 150 training rules, comprising the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i>, and a relatively small number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> compared to what we have now. The total number of rules would have been in the range 150 to 200, but probably closer to 150. Moreover, this number would have been in flux as new rules were added as and when required. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i>, and probably also the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aniyatas</i>, were part of the Pātimokkha, but were not considered training rules. These rules, rather, were part of the broader Vinaya material that was included in the Pātimokkha, for which see below.</p>
<p>The above result is reinforced by another <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato">AN 4.244</a>, which only mentions four classes of offenses, that is, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i>. This is in contrast to the Parivāra, which mentions either five or seven classes, adding <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭas</i> in the first instance, and additionally <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccayas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dubbhāsitas</i> in the second.<a epub:type='noteref' href='/en/brahmali#introduction-note-8' id='introduction-noteref-8' role='doc-noteref'>8</a> The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccayas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dubbhāsitas</i> are not mentioned in the Pātimokkha, but what about the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭas</i>? Are they not found in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>? To answer this, we first need to note that, unlike all the other classes of rules, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> do not include any offense in the rule formulation. Only in the Vibhaṅga do we find a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa</i> offense for breaking these rules out of disrespect. If we assume that the Vibhaṅga material was added some time after the formulation of the rules, for which there is significant evidence,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-9' id='introduction-noteref-9' role='doc-noteref'>9</a> then in the earliest period the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> were not strictly offenses, but rather general rules of training. It follows that the main rules of the Pātimokkha, those that result in specific offenses and which are the core rules of the Vinaya Piṭaka as a whole, are the four classes mentioned at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244">AN 4.244</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps not as surprising as it may at first seem, for it is rather curious that there are four different classes of offenses that are all cleared by simple confession. In addition to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i>, which as we have seen are among the earliest offenses, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccayas</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭas</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dubbhāsitas</i> are all clearable in this way. It is not at all obvious why the Buddha would have laid down four different classes of offenses that are resolved in the same way. A solution to this conundrum may be that the Buddha never laid down the latter three classes at all, but that they emerged over time. The fact that a text as late as the Parivāra speaks of five <i translate='no' lang='pli'>or</i> seven classes of offenses, as if there was a disagreement or evolution in the number, supports this contention. There is also some direct textual evidence to suggest that these offenses originally were general ways of describing wrong conduct and only later became classes of offenses. The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkata</i>,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-10' id='introduction-noteref-10' role='doc-noteref'>10</a> for instance, is used quite commonly in the general sense of “bad conduct”, without being referred to as an offense, an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āpatti</i>. An example of this, found in Kd 9, is the expression <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa kamma</i>, which just means a badly done legal procedure. My suggestion, then, is that these three classes of offenses initially were just general ways of speaking of bad conduct. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccayas</i> would have been “serious faults”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkatas</i> “bad conduct”, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dubbhāsitas</i> “bad speech”. I conclude that the earliest Vinaya probably only had the four classes of offenses mentioned at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato">AN 4.244</a>.</p>
<p>I now wish to return to the unexpected inclusion of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> in the Pātimokkha. As mentioned above, the evidence seems to suggest that they have belonged to the Pātimokkha from the earliest period and thus that they are an integral part of it. This forces us to reconsider the traditional view that the Pātimokkha is no more than a series of training rules. In fact, once we look at the Pātimokkha with this in mind, we discover many other “anomalies” that point in the same direction. Here are a few of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#7.1.16.1">Bu Pj 1</a> includes the important stipulation that if one renounces the training in advance, one cannot commit this offense. This is not directly related to the rule at hand, but is rather a general principle of Monastic Law. At the end of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offenses, we find a section describing the procedure for clearing such offenses. This is another general principle that is not immediately related to the committing of these offenses. Next, we have the two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aniyata</i> rules, which are principles for deciding the severity of an offense, not offenses as such. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali#1.3.7">Bu NP 10</a>, we find an extended procedure for how to appoint an attendant to receive and manage funds on behalf of a monastic, none of which relates directly to the committing of the offense in that rule. This is just a quick summary of some obvious cases, but the point is clear: the Pātimokkha includes quite a bit of general Vinaya material. Why is this so?</p>
<p>I have made the point in the General Introduction that the word Vinaya did not refer to the Vinaya Piṭaka in the earliest period for the simple reason that no such Piṭaka existed. The word Pātimokkha, by contrast, is encountered quite frequently in the earliest texts, in total over one hundred times in the four main Nikāyas, including several mentions in the Pātimokkha itself at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/brahmali#1.20.1">Bu Pc 72</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc73/en/brahmali#1.15.1">73</a>, and also in the introduction, the Pātimokkha-nidāna. As such, it is reasonable to think that the Pātimokkha is older than the Vinaya Piṭaka. Nevertheless, although there was no Vinaya Piṭaka in the earliest period, the accumulating Vinaya material would have had to be somehow organized. Now, since we see quite a bit of Vinaya material in the Pātimokkha, my suggestion is that all this material was included within the Pātimokkha, making the Pātimokkha a kind of proto Vinaya Piṭaka, from which the full Piṭaka later evolved. And so the Pātimokkha may have started as a repository for rules, which would have been needed early on, and then developed to include all material that dealt with the regulations of monastic life.</p>
<p>This way of thinking about the Pātimokkha helps us better understand several of its peculiarities. One of these is the fact that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> do not follow the usual structure of the Pātimokkha rules. We are now in a position to explain why this might be so, for which see the discussion of these rules at the end of the introduction to volume 2. We may also be in a better position to understand why the Buddha used the unusual word Pātimokkha. If the Pātimokkha were no more than a set of training rules, we would probably have seen a different name, perhaps a word connected to the idea of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sikkhāpada</i>, “a training rule”. Instead, we have the coinage of a new term, which suggests that we are dealing with more than a set of training rules and instead with a new and unique literature. The word itself may well be derived from the idea of liberation, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mokkha</i>, via the prefix <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṭi/pati</i>, which can be understood in a number of ways.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-11' id='introduction-noteref-11' role='doc-noteref'>11</a> It makes good sense that the Buddha would have used a word that relates to liberation to name the corpus of rules and regulations that govern the monastic life.</p>
<p>Before we take a more detailed look at the specific content of the Sutta-vibhaṅga, we need to briefly discuss why the Buddha laid down the Pātimokkha in the first place. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#5.11.32">Bu Pj 1:5.11.32</a>, and several other places in the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Buddha gives a list of ten reasons for laying down a training rule. These reasons can be summarized as the well-being of the monastics, the increase of faith in the Dhamma, and the longevity of the Dhamma. It is interesting that the focus is on supporting the spiritual life and not on protecting people from others’ bad conduct. In other words, although many of the rules were laid down on moral grounds, their main purpose is to protect the potential perpetrator, not the potential victim, especially if the victim is a non-monastic. On reflection, this is to be expected since the Dhamma is a personal spiritual path and not the equivalent of secular law. And this is also why there is more emphasis in the Vinaya on protecting monastic victims as opposed to non-monastics. I will note some such instances as I look at the individual rules below.</p>
<p>Yet the rules of the Pātimokkha, and indeed the whole Vinaya Piṭaka, are more than moral injunctions. A common reason for the Buddha to lay down a new rule is the complaints of lay supporters. These complaints are often about monastics indulging in sensuality comparable to lay life. A significant number of rules were therefore laid down to curb such indulgence and to stop the acquisition of goods that were regarded as too luxurious.</p>
<h2 id="the-personalities-of-the-sutta-vibhaṅga">The personalities of the Sutta-vibhaṅga</h2>
<p>This might be the right place to say a few words about the various characters one meets in the Vinaya Piṭaka. It is often assumed in Buddhist circles that ancient India was an especially good time and place to be reborn. Those who were able to meet the Buddha in person would surely only be able to do so because of a vast store of good <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> from the past. Their spiritual faculties would have been highly developed and they would have attained awakening with relative ease. The present generation, by contrast, has no such store of good <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> from the past, which may make it impossible to make real progress on the path. Our best strategy might be to accumulate the requisite <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> and wait for the next Buddha to arise. And indeed, when one reads the Suttas, which tend to be full of highly inspiring monastics and lay people, one might well come away with such a one-sided view.</p>
<p>The Vinaya Piṭaka quickly disabuses us of such a rose-tinted view of the past. When you see the mischief the people of ancient India got up to, you realize that humanity has always been more or less the same. Read in the right way, this is very encouraging for our present generation. It means that we are in all probability neither more nor less spiritually developed than past generations. If it was possible to reach awakening then, it will also be possible now.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of the origin stories to the Pātimokkha rules—for an explanation of which see the next section—is that certain monastics tend to feature again and again, often in relation to certain kinds of offenses. It is not entirely clear whether this is because some people ended up as caricatures who were employed in the origin stories to illustrate the commission of particular kinds of offenses or whether certain people just committed lots of offenses. The reality is probably a mix of both. An example of the former is the notorious group of six monks who become an empty vessel into which all sorts of wrong conduct was projected. No doubt these monks were historical figures, since they occur so frequently in all sorts of places, both prominent and obscure. Still, when we see that all the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> offenses bar three were first committed by this group, we suspect that these origin stories are artificial and the group of six are used in a stereotypical fashion to provide suitable perpetrators. This impression is reinforced by the fact that the vast majority of origin stories in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> chapter are no more than bare bones, with virtually no narrative apart from saying that the group of six monks committed the offense in question. What we are seeing is a group of people used as a literary device, not as historically real, at least in some contexts.</p>
<p>There are other characters, however, who have a greater claim to being proper historical figures, not the least because their personalities are drawn in quite a bit of detail. One such person is the monk Udāyī, who became notorious for his sexual shenanigans. He is the originator of four important <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> rules, numbers 2–5, all dealing with serious sexual misconduct, and also plays an important role in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> 1, which concerns masturbation. As rules were laid down and his avenues for expressing his defilements were gradually cut off, he would venture further afield trying to find satisfaction for his urges through all sorts of dubious conduct. He would meet women in private, either speaking Dhamma or frivolously, as the circumstances would allow, see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1/en/brahmali#1.1">Ay 1</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2/en/brahmali#1.1">Ay 2</a>; at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np4/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu NP 4</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc30/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 30</a> he meets up with his ex-wife to indulge in completely unrestrained behavior; at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu NP 5</a> he asks a nun to give him her lower robe, presumably to see her naked; at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 7</a> he teaches Dhamma to women by whispering in their ears; at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc26/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 26</a> he sews a robe with an indecent design and gives it to a nun. It seems he was also cruel, as a certain Udāyī killed crows almost as a hobby, thereby becoming the originator of the rule against killing animals at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 61</a>.</p>
<p>Another character who makes a frequent showing in the Vinaya Piṭaka is Upananda the Sakyan. His main defilement was an excessive greed for robes and cloth. He is the originator of a significant number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiya</i> rules, specifically numbers <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali#1.1.1">6</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np8/en/brahmali#1.1.1">8</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np9/en/brahmali#1.1">9</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali#1.1.1">10</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali#1.1">18</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np20/en/brahmali#1.1">20</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np25/en/brahmali#1.1">25</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np27/en/brahmali#1.1">27</a>. Except for Bu NP 18, all of these relate to his greed for robes and robe-cloth. In Bu NP 18 he receives money after himself suggesting that it be given. It is perhaps not too outlandish to speculate that he used the money on cloth! Yet Upananda, too, enjoyed the company of women. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 42</a>–45 were all laid down as a consequence of Upananda’s misbehavior in this area. Upananda was also the originator of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 46</a>, concerned with visiting private homes at the wrong time, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc58/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 58</a> where his greed for robes once again is on display. Finally, he is the originator of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc87/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 87</a>, a rule that concerns the use of luxurious beds. In addition to this, he is indirectly involved in a number of other rules.</p>
<p>There is something realistic about these characters. Strong defilements are difficult to overcome and so it is not unreasonable to think that a single person could be behind such a large number of offenses. The world was much the same then as it is now. Where the Suttas show us the human potential, the Vinaya Piṭaka shows us a darker side of humanity.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to a more detailed consideration of the content of the Sutta-vibhaṅga.</p>
<h2 id="the-introduction-to-the-sutta-vibhaṅga">The introduction to the Sutta-vibhaṅga</h2>
<p>The Monks’ Analysis begins with a story of how the Pātimokkha rules came to be laid down. The story begins at the village of Verañjā,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-12' id='introduction-noteref-12' role='doc-noteref'>12</a> with a brahmin objecting to the Buddha’s revolutionary new teachings. The Buddha then describes his awakening experience, upon which the brahmin accepts his superior insight and becomes a disciple. The purpose of this preamble is presumably to establish the Buddha’s authority in laying down the rules for the monks and the nuns. The story then goes on to tell of two incidents where the Buddha is required to intervene in the lives of his disciples. Yet since the monks involved, Ānanda and Mahāmoggallāna, were pure and easy to correct, gentle guidance from the Buddha was sufficient. One point of these stories is perhaps to show that the laying down of rules was inevitable. Another is no doubt to make it clear that the most eminent monastics, especially the fully awakened ones such as Mahāmoggallāna, accept the Buddha’s guidance without argument.</p>
<p>We now come to the essence of this introductory section. Sāriputta approaches the Buddha and asks him to lay down rules so that the Dhamma may last for a long time. The Buddha responds that he does not lay down rules until certain causes for corruption arise in the Sangha.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s response is interesting for several reasons. First, it shows that the Buddha was a pragmatist. Rules are laid down to counter existing problems, not potential ones. One reason for this is presumably that it is very difficult to tailor solutions to future problems. In fact, it is difficult enough to lay down rules that are appropriate for existing problems. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32/en/brahmali#1.15.0">Bu Pc 32</a>, for instance, we see that the Buddha has to amend the rule a full six times to make it workable. In total over 40 of the monks’ rules needed to be amended, including all the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offenses. In the Khandhakas, we even find cases of the Buddha having to abolish rules because they prove impractical, such as the prohibition against eating mangoes (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#5.1.18">Kd 15:5.1.18</a>), which was subsequently overturned (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#5.2.9">Kd 15:5.2.9</a>). What we see, then, is that the Buddha’s approach to dealing with problems is to tailor fairly precise solutions. He does not try to anticipate the future.</p>
<p>Second, the Buddha’s response suggests that he was not omniscient, at least not in the broadest sense of the term. If he could fully foresee the future, the most straightforward and simple solution to avoid future problems would have been to lay down all the monastic rules at the outset of his teaching career. Moreover, he would not have to keep on amending certain rules. And so, the way the monastic rules were laid down is one of the strongest arguments against the traditional Buddhist view that the Buddha was omniscient.</p>
<p>The introduction comes to an end with the Buddha departing Verañjā and walking to Vesālī, a distance of over 900 kilometers following the modern network of roads, according to Google Maps. This sets the stage for the origin story to first offense entailing expulsion, which takes place near Vesālī.</p>
<h2 id="the-monks-pātimokkha-rules-and-their-analysis">The Monks’ Pātimokkha rules and their analysis</h2>
<p>Apart from this brief introduction, the bulk of the Monks’ Analysis is devoted to a technical discussion of the Pātimokkha rules, starting with the most serious offenses. We then encounter the various classes of offenses in descending order of importance, ending with a number of rules that are not offenses at all, but procedural in nature. We will discuss each class in turn, and note some of the interesting features and details of each one. Before getting into too many details, however, we will have a look at how the analysis of each rule is structured. There will be some overlap in content with the General Introduction found above.</p>
<p>At the center of the Monks’ Analysis is the Pātimokkha, the Monastic Code, consisting of the most important rules that every <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i>, or monk, is supposed to keep by virtue of being a monastic. These rules are the oldest part of the Sutta-vibhaṅga, most of them probably originating with the Buddha himself, as I have argued in more detail above. The Pātimokkha rules are by far the most important content of the Sutta-vibhaṅga. As such, they are recited every fortnight in most monastic communities, a tradition that itself stems from the earliest period of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Around these Pātimokkha rules, there arose, over time, a copious explanatory framework, which forms the bulk of the Sutta-vibhaṅga. This framework is divided into several parts, starting with an origin story that describes the circumstances in which each rule was laid down. A rule is then formulated. Often there are further developments, described in subsequent origin stories, that necessitate additions to the rule, either expanding them or setting limitations. This then culminates in the formulation of a final rule, which is the rule as we find it in the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>Next comes the word analysis, known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>padabhājanīya</i>, which defines significant words or phrases in the rule. Sometimes this is no more than the giving of a series of synonyms, but at other times it involves lengthy sections with detailed explanations, for instance, the explanation of disrobal, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sikkhaṁ paccakkhāya</i>, at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#8.2.1">Bu Pj 1:8.2.1</a>–8.4.21.</p>
<p>The word analysis is usually followed by a “permutation series”, which sets out various combinations of factors for which the offense in question is either fulfilled, partially fulfilled, or not fulfilled. A partially fulfilled offense will often result in the incurring of a lesser offense. For the serious offenses, that is, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>, these permutation series are particularly long, often amounting to more than half of a rule’s total word count. Sometimes the permutation series adds important details to our understanding of a rule, yet too often it seems to be little more than an exercise in the mechanical listing of all possible combinations of factors that may give rise to a specific offense, with little gained in terms of understanding. These series sometimes employ a specialized terminology, found at the end of sections, to help the reader keep track of how the series evolves. I have provided a separate addendum to explain this terminology, see Appendix II: Specialized Vocabulary.</p>
<p>Then comes the non-offense clause, which lists a number of circumstances in which there is no offense. There are certain universal non-offenses, namely, insanity, being possessed or deranged, being overwhelmed by pain, or being the first offender. This last class refers to the person who gave rise to the rule. In other words, the rules do not apply retroactively.</p>
<p>The final part of the analysis of each rule is a series of case studies where the Buddha adjudicates a specific action and declares whether the monastic has committed an offense or not. These case studies only exist for a small subset of rules, specifically the four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i> and the first five <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>.</p>
<h3 id="the-pārājikas-pj">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i> (Pj)</h3>
<p>We are now ready to look more closely at each class of offenses and some of the individual rules within them. We start with the most serious offenses, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>. Any monastic who commits such an offense is by default expelled from the monastic community, whether anyone else knows of the offense or not. They are barred from being a fully ordained monk or nun, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>, for the rest of their life. There are four such offenses for the monks. In what follows, whenever a rule is held in common between the monks and the nuns, I speak of “a monastic” rather than “a monk”.</p>
<p>The gravity of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense is expressed through a simile found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato#1.3">AN 4.244</a>, which compares committing the offense to having one’s head chopped off. The loss of one’s head is obviously related to the irreversibility of one’s exclusion from the Sangha. The symbolism is a powerful testimony to the importance placed on monastic life in the early <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i>.</p>
<p>The first <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense concerns sexual intercourse. As always, the text starts with an origin story, which in the present case gives an account of the rather tragic events in the life of the young man Sudinna. He starts out being extremely inspired by the Buddha and his teaching, but then succumbs to the demands from his family of producing an heir to the family fortune. It is thus that he ends up having sexual intercourse with his ex-wife, resulting in profound remorse. Both his ex-wife and son end up ordaining, eventually becoming <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahants</i>, whereas Sudinna fades away into obscurity.</p>
<p>This story is remarkable in that it is almost identical to the story of Raṭṭhapāla in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn82/en/sujato">MN 82</a>. The main difference between the two stories is that Raṭṭhapāla ends up as an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahant</i>, thus fulfilling his great potential. Ven. Anālayo argues convincingly that the story at MN 82 is the original from which the current story was taken and adapted.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-13' id='introduction-noteref-13' role='doc-noteref'>13</a> This points to an important principle of interpretation. Although the Pātimokkha rules go back to the earliest period of Buddhism, this is not necessarily true of the Vibhaṅga material. In other words, the Vibhaṅga may not, or may not always, go back to the Buddha himself. This view is supported by a scan of the recent translation by Ven. Vimalañāṇī of the Mahāsāṅghika version of the Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-14' id='introduction-noteref-14' role='doc-noteref'>14</a> The origin stories are for the most part different from those found in the Pali. For a further discussion of this, see the separate introduction to the Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga in volume 3.</p>
<p>The Vibhaṅga continues with two further origin stories, upon which the final rule is laid down. It is through the last of these origin stories that the final version of the rule comes to include the important stipulation that if one renounces the training in advance, one cannot commit this offense.</p>
<p>We then come to the word analysis, which includes a long section on the meaning of renouncing the training, followed by the permutation series. This series focuses on what kind of partner and orifice fulfill the offense. At the end of this long permutation series comes a second and much shorter series. This series is not directly connected to the previous one. Moreover, it uses a non-standard vocabulary, especially the pair <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i> (literally, “path” and “non-path”, but see Appendix I: Technical Terms for an explanation), as well as the verbs <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vippaṭipajjati</i> (“to rape”) and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i> (“to expel”), none of which is otherwise used in the context of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>. This leads to the question of what the relationship is between these two apparently unconnected permutation series. On the assumption that greater detail and a standardized vocabulary are signs of later development, it seems likely that the second part of the permutation series is the earlier part, with the first part added at a later time. We see similar developments in a number of other rules, including <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> 2 and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu saṅghādisesas</i> 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.</p>
<p>At the end of the two permutation series, we find the non-offense clause, which in addition to the standard non-offenses adds “not knowing” and “not consenting”. Then come the case studies, headed by a series of mnemonic verses. A number of these cases are interesting. To begin with, one of the cases concerns a nun, specifically the rape of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā. Because the nuns do not have a separate Vibhaṅga for the rules they have in common with the monks, it is natural for such cases to be included here. In fact, there are further such cases below (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#10.6.6">Bu Pj 1:10.6.6</a>), as well as in the next two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offenses (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.6.20">Bu Pj 2:7.6.20</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.45.1">Bu Pj 2:7.45.1</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.45.12">Bu Pj 2:7.45.12</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/brahmali#5.33.10">Bu Pj 3:5.33.10</a>).</p>
<p>Another interesting case is one where a monastic has a gender change, apparently for natural reasons. According to the story, the Buddha says that the monastic concerned should simply join the Sangha of the opposite gender. This leads to the unexpected situation that we have a precedent in the Vinaya Piṭaka for how to include transgender people within the Sangha. Moreover, this episode suggests that the Buddha tried to find solutions to give everyone a chance to become or remain as a monk or a nun, regardless of their identity. It seems reasonable to infer from this that we should look for ways to make the Sangha as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>The second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> starts with the story of the monk Dhaniya who tricks the keeper of King Bimbisāra’s woodyard to give him wood. The Buddha then lays down a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> for stealing. Observers have pointed out that there is a mismatch here between the action that led to the rule and the actual rule. Dhaniya did not, strictly speaking, steal the wood. Rather, it was given to him after he deceived the caretaker of the woodyard. It follows that Dhaniya’s actions did not amount to a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense under this rule. There are similar discrepancies between the origin stories and the rule also in other cases, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np4/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu NP 4</a>. The interesting question then arises of why there are such discrepancies.</p>
<p>It has been suggested by some, such as Oskar von Hinüber,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-15' id='introduction-noteref-15' role='doc-noteref'>15</a> that this mismatch between rule and origin story must be the result of the origin stories having been added later, after the original events were forgotten. This, however, does not seem very plausible, for it implies an unaccountable incompetency on the part of the early Sangha. If the origin stories were fabricated, it is much more likely that they would match the rule very closely. Indeed, this is exactly what we find in the case of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>. In these rules, in which the origin stories in most cases are no more than short stereotypical formulas, and which involve the group of six monks in 72 out of 75 rules, it seems indisputable that they have been fabricated. Moreover, in most of these 72 cases the origin story is either just a verbatim repetition of the misconduct described in the rule or a short phrase closely related to it. In other words, we have strong evidence to suggest that artificial origin stories tend to be a perfect match for the rule they belong with.</p>
<p>What, then, might be the reason for the observed discrepancies? I have already made the case that the Vibhaṅga material is later than the actual rules. If this is so, then the origin stories would have faded in memory by the time it was decided they should be included as part of the textual heritage. In some cases, such as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pārājika</i> 1 and 3,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-16' id='introduction-noteref-16' role='doc-noteref'>16</a> this fading would have resulted in details being recalled incorrectly. In other cases, especially for the nuns’ rules,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-17' id='introduction-noteref-17' role='doc-noteref'>17</a> the Sangha would have been unsure of which origin story was historically correct and would probably have used a suitable anecdote to fill the gap. This, then, would have led to a mismatch between origin story and rule. Indeed, it stands as a testimony to the fidelity of the Sangha to the received tradition that they did <em>not</em> alter these stories even though they must have been aware of these discrepancies. We should see the mismatch as a sign of the conservatism of the reciters. They preserved the texts as handed down and only made corrections if they had very good reasons to suspect textual corruption.</p>
<p>There might, however, be another cause for the perceived mismatch. I believe there is no good reason why the origin stories should always be a perfect lead-up to the subsequent laying down of a rule. Upon seeing a problem in the Sangha, the Buddha would have laid down whatever rule seemed appropriate to deal with the situation. In <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> 2, although Dhaniya did not technically steal, his actions were tantamount to stealing. The laying down of the rule can be explained without the need for a perfectly fitting origin story.</p>
<p>In the last section of this rule, we again find several interesting case studies. One story concerns a monk who takes a rag from a fresh corpse. The monk must have gotten a shock when the corpse tells him not to steal the cloth. Still, the monk pays no heed, upon which the corpse gets up and follows behind him, before collapsing outside the monk’s hut. This is presumably the first zombie story in the history of literature, with Hollywood being a Johnny-come-lately to the genre and perhaps ultimately inspired by the Vinaya Piṭaka itself! As so often, Buddhism was there first. In any case, the Buddha laid down a rule that a monastic should not take cloth from a fresh corpse. Who said the Vinaya was not entertaining?</p>
<p>The last case study at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.49.1">Bu Pj 2</a> relates the brief story of a monk who tells his teacher that he has committed a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> by stealing a turban. The teacher, however, is not content with just accepting his student’s word. He asks the student to bring the turban, and then has it valued. They discover that the value is below the threshold for committing a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>. And so, it turns out that the student has not committed a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> after all. This goes to show that it is the duty of a teacher, and presumably any fellow monastic, to go to some length to help a co-monastic get out of trouble, if at all possible.</p>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pārājika</i> 3, which concerns the killing of a human being, begins with the extraordinary story of a large number of monks seeking to die after hearing a teaching from the Buddha on the contemplation of the impurity of the body. When the Buddha emerges from solitary retreat after two weeks, the Sangha is much diminished. The story is found in much the same form in all extant Vinayas, which suggests it is likely to reflect a real historical event. Moreover, because this story puts Buddhism and even the Buddha in a bad light, it is unlikely to have been inserted as a fictional addition by later generations.</p>
<p>Apart from concluding that the story may well be true, it is hard to know what to make of it. Ven. Anālayo gives it a valiant try and concludes that the story “reflects the influence of a prevalent negative attitude towards the body and the tolerance of suicide in ancient Indian ascetic circles”.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-18' id='introduction-noteref-18' role='doc-noteref'>18</a> In any case, this motivates the Buddha to teach mindfulness of breathing, with the standard set of sixteen steps set out at this point. This is by no means the only inclusion of such typical <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> material in the Vinaya Piṭaka. We find a significant number of such instances throughout the collection, especially in the Khandhakas, including three full <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i> at the start of Kd 1. The Suttas and the Vinaya are complementary aspects of the Dhamma that are interwoven to form a complete picture of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>
<p>Coming to the case studies, the very first one tells the story of monks who, out of compassion, spoke to a sick monk in favor of dying. Despite the wholesome motivation, the Buddha says that they have nevertheless committed <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offenses. Further on, there are cases that treat abortion in a similar fashion. This means that a monastic may never suggest dying for any reason whatsoever, no matter how positively motivated. It is important to realize, however, that this is not the final word on contentious moral issues such as euthanasia or abortion. Monastic Law and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> are two different things. The Monastic Law was laid down for a number of reasons, whereas <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> is governed strictly by intention. This is as true in the area of euthanasia or abortion as it is for any other.</p>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pārājika</i> 4 concerns falsely claiming supernormal powers. It may at first seem surprising that this should be regarded as so serious. On reflection, however, one realizes that such claims subvert the very purpose of the spiritual life for selfish purposes. In the origin story, a group of monks claimed such powers so as to get fed by the lay supporters during a famine. The Buddha states that this is the worst possible kind of theft.</p>
<p>The second half of the case studies involves a series of supernormal claims that may seem like boasts, but that turn out to be true. In each case the Buddha steps in to correct the doubters. The point of this series is presumably to make it clear that all sorts of psychic experiences are possible, and that one should be careful with jumping to the conclusion that such claims are false.</p>
<p>The four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i> end with a short passage stating that anyone who commits any of them is no longer a monastic. However, there is no prohibition in the Vinaya for a such a person to carry on as a novice monk or nun.</p>
<h3 id="the-saṅghādisesas-ss">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i> (Ss)</h3>
<p>After the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>, the second most important class of rules are known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesas</i>, “the offenses entailing suspension”. Together with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikas</i>, they are known as “the heavy offenses”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garukāpatti</i>. The rest of the Pātimokkha offenses are light, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>lahukāpatti</i>.</p>
<p>A monk who commits a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offense must undergo a trial period of six days. If he hides his offense, he must additionally undergo a period of probation equal in length to the number of days he hid his offense. If he behaves properly during this period, that is, according to the rules laid down in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd12/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Kd 12</a>, he is to be rehabilitated by a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sangha</i> of at least 20 monks. The severity of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offense is conveyed through a simile found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato#2.1">AN 4.244</a>, which compares the offense to being beaten in public with a club. There are thirteen such offenses for the monks.</p>
<p>The first four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offenses are sexual in nature. In terms of how often they are committed, the first three of these—masturbation, groping, and indecent speech—are by far the most important, which is presumably why they are listed first. It is striking that sexual expression is considered to be such a serious fault, especially since sexuality is often celebrated in lay life. Part of this is about the sexual harassment aspect of such behavior. But more broadly, it reflects the danger that sexuality poses for progress on the spiritual path and the ease with which one may get trapped in sensuality. These rules, then, create a barrier to getting stuck in the sensory realm.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/brahmali#2.2.13.1">Bu Ss 5</a> prohibits matchmaking. It is probably this rule that is at the root of Buddhist monastics not officiating at marriage ceremonies. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/brahmali#1.6.6.1">Bu Ss 6</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7/en/brahmali#1.19.1">Bu Ss 7</a> concern construction, specifically not putting up an oversize hut or building in the wrong location. These rules are in part about monastics not burdening their lay supporters unreasonably. The origin story to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Bu Ss 6</a> includes a Jātaka tale known as the Maṇikaṇṭha-jātaka, number 253 of that collection. There are further Jātaka tales in the Sutta-vibhaṅga and the Khandhakas, which is one among many indicators that this part of the Vinaya is later than the earliest parts of the Sutta Piṭaka.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-19' id='introduction-noteref-19' role='doc-noteref'>19</a> This rule also incorporates a story that seems to appear nowhere else in the Pali corpus, as well as a reference to Raṭṭhapāla and his father, the two main protagonists of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn82/en/sujato">MN 82</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8/en/brahmali#1.9.32.1">Bu Ss 8</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss9/en/brahmali#1.2.14.1">Bu Ss 9</a> are to do with falsely accusing a fellow monk of having committed a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense. Groundlessly accusing a monk of a lesser offense is an offense at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc76/en/brahmali#1.11.1">Bu Pc 76</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu Ss 8</a> starts with the entertaining story of Dabba the Mallian who is said to have become an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahant</i> at the age of seven and then spent his life in service to the Sangha. One of his jobs was to assign dwellings to newly-arrived monks. When monks arrived late at night, he would enter the fire element, make his finger glow, and then take the monks to their huts using his finger as a flashlight!</p>
<p>There is also a darker side to the story of Dabba the Mallian. At some point, the two bad monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, who were members of the notorious group of six monks, developed a grudge against Dabba. They then had the nun Mettiyā go to the Buddha and falsely accuse Dabba of raping her. The Buddha asks Dabba whether this is true, which he denies, and the Buddha then exonerates him on the basis of his perfect memory. This is how “resolution through recollection”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sativinaya</i>, becomes established as the second of the seven “principles for settling legal issues”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali#4.10.10">Kd 14:4.10.10</a>). The more troubling aspect of this incident is that the Buddha then expels the nun Mettiyā despite the fact that her conduct was at most grounds for a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offense. A solution to this unexpected expulsion, according to Ven. Anālayo, may be found in the Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya, according to which Mettiyā, or whatever she is called by the Mahāsāṅghikas, was already pregnant by someone else.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-20' id='introduction-noteref-20' role='doc-noteref'>20</a></p>

Eventually, on the Buddha’s instruction, the Sangha imposes the “supreme penalty”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>brahmadaṇḍa</i>, on him. He then sees the errors of his ways and even becomes an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahant</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.15.1">Kd 21:1.15.1</a>–1.15.16). <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu Ss 13</a> once again concerns the group of six monks. In this case they corrupt the lay supporters at a place called Kīṭāgiri and draw them away from the true Dhamma. The story is developed further in connection with the legal procedure of banishment (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/brahmali#13.1.1">Kd 11:13.1.1</a>–17.2.18).</p>
<p>The last four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offenses are special in that they require the Sangha to perform a legal procedure that in effect admonishes the offending monk and gives him the opportunity to mend his ways. If he refuses, then the offense is committed once the legal procedure has been completed.</p>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> chapter ends with the procedure for clearing such offenses, which, as noted above, is one among a number of similar passages that make it clear that the Pātimokkha is more than a simple set of training rules. The procedure for clearing offenses is expanded on in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd12/en/brahmali">Kd 12</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd13/en/brahmali">Kd 13</a>, which give a great amount of detail as to how it is to be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="the-aniyatas-ay">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aniyatas</i> (Ay)</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aniyata</i> means indeterminate. There are only two such rules, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1/en/brahmali#1.32.1">Ay 1</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2/en/brahmali#1.19.1">Ay 2</a>. They are called indeterminate because they are not a class of offenses, but rather procedures for deciding what offense has been committed. Once this is decided, one makes amends according to the relevant class of offense, either <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i>, or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i>.</p>
<p>The remaining rules for monks are discussed in the introduction to volume 2.</p>

<p>Modern versions of the Vinaya Piṭaka divide the Sutta-vibhaṅga into two volumes, known as Pārājika-pāḷi and Pacittiya-pāḷi. This division is not mentioned in any of the texts available in the online VRI version, and seems to be an entirely modern division, presumably to fit the text into suitable volumes for printing. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>

<p>The counting of rules is not as straightforward as it may seem. Two of the versions used by Pachow are not recensions of the Pātimokkha as such, but other kinds of texts that include the Pātimokkha rules. I have not included these versions. Then there is the problem of multiple Pātimokkhas of the same school. In these cases, I have counted a rule only if it exists in all versions of a specific school. The counting could be done differently, but the results would not change dramatically. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>
