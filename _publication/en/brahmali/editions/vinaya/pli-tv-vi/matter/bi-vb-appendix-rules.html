<h1>Appendix: Technical Discussion of Individual Bhikkhunī Rules</h1>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 1</h3>
<p>This rule is largely identical with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pārājika</i> 1, except for a slight change of wording. For reference, here are the monks’ and the nuns’ versions of this rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a monk, after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is expelled and excluded from the community.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#7.1.16.1">Bu Pj 1:7.1.16.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a nun willingly has sexual intercourse, even with a male animal, she is expelled and excluded from the community.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-pm/en/brahmali#9.1">Bi Pm:9.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two main differences. The nuns’ rule adds the word “willingly”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chandaso</i>, while it omits the phrase “after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness”.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a> I’ve discussed both at length in the introduction to this volume and have nothing to add here.</p>
<p>There are also two minor gender changes, which do warrant commenting on. The agent of the rule is now a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> rather than a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i>, which affects the grammatical gender of any words that agree with the agent, of which there are three in this particular rule (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>yā</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājikā</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>asaṁvāsā</i>). This is merely a mechanical change that affects all the rules that the monks and the nuns have in common. It has no bearing on the nature or scope of the offense.</p>
<p>The other minor change is marginally more interesting. Towards the end of the rule we find the clause <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antamaso tiracchānagatāyapi</i>, “even with a male animal”, which means that the offense is incurred even for having sex with an animal. For the monks we find the feminine ending, -<i translate='no' lang='pli'>āya</i>, whereas for the nuns we have the masculine ending, -<i translate='no' lang='pli'>ena</i>. This is as expected, since it reasonable to assume that even in the exceptional case of sex with an animal it is more likely to happen with an animal of the opposite sex. This might seem to suggest that one would not incur an offense for having sex with an animal of one’s own gender. However, we know from the detailed exposition of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> 1 that such sex, too, incurs the full penalty under this rule (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.1.24">Bu Pj 1:9.1.24</a>).</p>
<p>How then do we explain the gender difference in the animal? The most likely explanation is that the grammatical ending reflects the fact that an animal is either male or female, which means there can be no neutral grammatical ending for animals. And given the lack of a neutral ending, it is only natural to pair the feminine ending with the monks’ rule and the masculine ending with the one for the nuns. The fact that one is forced to make a grammatical gender choice, however, does not mean that the rule is restricted to animals of the equivalent gender.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 5</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 5 presents us with the seemingly strange case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> committing a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense by consenting to the touch of a man, but no offense at all if she herself touches a man. The rule reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on above the knees.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.nethttps://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali/en/brahmali#1.54.1">Bi Pj 5:1.54.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get our bearings, let’s start by investigating the Vibhaṅga. The word-definition section has no relevant information, but the permutation series does. Here is the first permutation, which is typical of the entire series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If both have lust and he/she makes physical contact, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits an offense entailing expulsion. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali#2.2.1">Bi Pj 5:2.2.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Makes physical contact” renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āmasati</i>. No agent is specified, and thus my provisional rendering “he/she”. Going by the wording of the rule, it would seem the agent must be the man. The commentary, however, states that the agent may be either the man or the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Makes physical contact, body with body: the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touches whatever (part of the) body of a man with her body as delimited, or the man touches the body of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> as delimited with whatever (part of) his body. In both cases, there is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense for the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anything in the Canonical text that supports the commentary? As it happens, there is one unusual case in the permutation series that deserves closer attention. The ambiguity in the agent continues for the entire permutation series, except in one case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If both have lust and she makes physical contact with a spirit, a ghost, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>, or an animal in human form, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits a serious offense. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali#2.2.29.1">Bi Pj 5:2.2.29.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the formulation of the rule, in this sentence it seems required that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is the agent. The various beings that are mentioned here are all in the genitive/dative case, which suggests they are not doing the touching, but are being touched. If the agent of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āmasati</i> in this case is the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>, then it would be natural to conclude that the same must be true for the entire permutation series. The parallels in wording are just too close. This might then be taken as lending support to the commentarial position, which would mean that the agent may be either the man or the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>. This would resolve the ambiguity.</p>
<p>Still, there are some immediate problems with the above suggestion. As we have just seen, the above sentence suggests that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is the only agent. Yet taking the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> as the sole agent for the entire permutation series goes too far, because it would fly in the face of the wording of the rule. What we have, in fact, are two different and irreconcilable positions: (i) the position of the rule, which says the man is the agent, and (ii) the position of the one sentence from the Vibhaṅga, which says the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is the agent. Only in the Commentary is this combined to suggest that either the man or the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> can be the agent in all cases, including in the rule. Yet it is by no means obvious that the commentary is right about this.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the sentence above that apparently concerns a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching various kinds of beings. The first problem with understanding this sentence as suggested is that it leaves out the case of these beings touching the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>. This is a rather major problem since the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> being touched, not the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching, is the concern of the main rule. It would mean that there is no statement anywhere about what the offense is if, for instance, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> consents to being touched by a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>. In this way, a secondary development of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> doing the touching would be mentioned, whereas the main concern of the rule would not.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the permutation series would then mention the case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching a number of beings of various kinds, including those belonging to non-human realms, but would not mention the case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching a man. Thus, the most important case, by far, would be left out.</p>
<p>Given these obvious problems, I do not think it is acceptable to read the entire permutation series in light of this one unusual sentence. Instead, I think we need to follow the reading of the rule, which is only concerned with the case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> consenting to a man touching her. The case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching a man would not be covered.</p>
<p>How, then, might we understand the one sentence on other beings in the permutation series? I would suggest this sentence has been corrupted and originally had a structure closer to the one in the main rule. In the main rule the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> consents to the touch of a man, the man being expressed in the genitive case, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>purisapuggalassa</i>. The syntax of the sentence is such that this makes the man the agent. I would suggest the beings in the permutation series that are expressed in the genitive case should be understood in the same way. They are meant to be the actual agents of the sentence. The syntax no longer supports this, and thus my proposal that there has been a corruption of the text at some point in history. Originally the syntax may have been similar to what we find in the main rule.</p>
<p>Once we look at the text in this way, the problems mentioned above disappear. The case of various beings touching the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is then no more than a subsidiary rule under the main one. And the case of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching a man would not be included.</p>
<p>This suggestion is supported by the parallels to this rule in Chinese translation. Here are the translations of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 5, as found in five different Vinayas, all translated from the Chinese by Bhikkhunī Vimalañāṇī:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>, with a defiled mind, allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to rub her up and down below the hairline and above the knees and the wrists, to pull, push, press, and squeeze her, to lift her up and set her down, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> commits a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, and doesn’t live in community.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we see the use of the word “allows”, which presumably functions in the same way as “consents to” in the Pali version. The Vibhaṅga to this rule then uses the same term throughout. This means that this is all about the man being the agent, not the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> with a defiled mind and a man with defiled mind have their bodies touch each other with the thought to feel pleasure, below the eyes and above the knees, even with the slightest touch in this way, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> incurs a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> and shouldn’t live in the community.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-4' id='introduction-noteref-4' role='doc-noteref'>4</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here both the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> and the man are agents. This would seem to mean that there is only the full offense if both are involved in the touching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> in a mind-state altered by abundant desire, lets a man rub and touch her in all kinds of ways below the hairline, above the knees, and above the elbows, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> incurs a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, and doesn’t live in community.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-5' id='introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-noteref'>5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Lets (rub and touch)” once again suggests that this has to do only with consent. No agency on the part of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is mentioned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> with a defiled mind, feels pleasure from being rubbed and touched below the shoulders and above the knees by a man with a defiled mind, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, and shouldn’t live in community.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-6' id='introduction-noteref-6' role='doc-noteref'>6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the term “feels pleasure” is likely to be equivalent to “consents to”. The Pali word behind “to consent” is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sādiyati</i>, which can also be rendered as “to feel pleasure”. This, then, is a third case of only the man being the agent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> with a defiled mind and a man with a defiled mind have their bodies touch each other below the armpits and above the knees; if they grasp, pull, push, rub upwards and downwards, lift up, set down, hold, and press each other, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, and doesn’t live in community, because she’s ‘one with bodily contact’.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-7' id='introduction-noteref-7' role='doc-noteref'>7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a second case of both the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> and the man being agents. Yet even here the Vibhaṅga focuses on the man as the agent.</p>
<p>If we include the Pali version, we have four cases where the man is the only agent, and two cases where also the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is an agent. This suggests that only the man being the agent is the earlier reading. Moreover, in the two rules where both are agents, the natural interpretation is that the rule is only broken if <i translate='no' lang='pli'>both</i> take part in the touching. And so again, if the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> is the sole agent, there would be no offense. We have a situation where the man touching is always required for the committing of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense, whereas the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> touching is never sufficient in itself.</p>
<p>My overall conclusion from this brief comparative study is that there is no <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense for a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> who touches a man, whether she is lustful or not, assuming the man does not touch her. I would suggest the Pali should be interpreted accordingly.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 8</h3>
<p>In <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 8 there is a series of eight actions. The question is whether a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> has to do all eight or whether doing a single one is enough to commit the offense. Here is the rule for reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding her hand and the edge of her robe, and she stands with him and chats with him and goes to a rendezvous with him and consents to him coming to her and enters a covered place with him and disposes her body for him for that purpose, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule having eight parts.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali#1.11.1">Bi Pj 8:1.11.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the surface, it appears as if doing any one of the eight is sufficient. The eight actions are connected with the disjunctive <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i>, which is almost universally translated as “or”. However, in the word definitions that immediately follow the rule formulation, it is equally clear that doing a single action is not enough to commit a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>. Doing any of the sub-actions is stated to be a serious offense, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccaya</i>. Going by this, all eight actions need to be done to incur the full offense of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, the interpretation of the word-definitions section is the only tenable one. Most of the sub-actions described in Bi Pj 8 are found as lesser rules elsewhere in the Bhikkhunī-pātimokkha. For instance, if “a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding her hand”, it is a serious offense at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali#2.1.11">Bi Pj 8:2.1.11</a>. Or if “a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding the edge of her robe”, it is again a serious offense under the same rule at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali#2.1.14">Bi Pj 8:2.1.14</a>. Or if “(a lustful nun) stands with him” or “she chats with him”, it is an offense entailing confession, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i>, at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc11/en/brahmali#1.12.1">Bi Pc 11</a>. I could go on, but that should be sufficient to make the point. Making each of the actions at Bi Pj 8 an offense of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> would clash with how these actions are treated elsewhere. Again, we are compelled to interpret this rule as all eight actions needing to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>This is also the position of the commentary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if she fulfills one of the eight or seven of the eight a hundred times, she is not expelled.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-8' id='introduction-noteref-8' role='doc-noteref'>8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moreover, according to the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī commentary, if, before committing the eighth and final action that would result in a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense, a nun confesses any of the previous seven partial transgressions, she does not incur a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, if she has committed one (of the actions), but then makes a pledge of obligation (to practice the rules) and then confesses, if she then commits an offense again because of defilements, and confesses again, then even if she fulfills the eighth factor, she does not commit an offense entailing expulsion.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-9' id='introduction-noteref-9' role='doc-noteref'>9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evidence, then, strongly suggests that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> in the rule must be understood as “and” rather than “or”. Taking a closer look at Pali literature, we discover that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> is quite commonly used as a conjunctive instead of a disjunctive. The same, it seems, is true for Sanskrit literature. Starting with the Sanskrit, SED says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vā</i> is sometimes interchangeable with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ca</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>api</i> … (sv. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Closer to home, the Pali commentaries frequently gloss <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as a conjunction, defining it with the terms <i translate='no' lang='pli'>samuccaya</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sampiṇḍana</i>, both of which refer to coming together, rather than disjunction. A particularly instructive case is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But there will be three dangers for Pāṭaliputta: fire, water, and (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i>) internal dissension.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-10' id='introduction-noteref-10' role='doc-noteref'>10</a> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#28.8.9">Kd 6:28.8.9</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the text is specific that there will be three dangers and so the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i>, “or”, cannot mean that only one of the three alternatives will occur. At the same time, it seems unlikely that the three should be seen as happening simultaneously, which may explain why <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ca</i>, “and”, is not used. It follows that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> here should most likely be understood conjunctively in the sense of all three occurring, but not conjunctively in the sense of happening simultaneously.</p>
<p>Another striking example of the same phenomenon is found in the Ānāpānassati Sutta. Here is the relevant extract in Pali, followed by a translation, rendering <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as “or”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dīghaṁ <b>vā</b> assasanto dīghaṁ assasāmīti pajānāti, dīghaṁ <b>vā</b> passasanto dīghaṁ passasāmīti pajānāti; rassaṁ <b>vā</b> assasanto rassaṁ assasāmīti pajānāti, rassaṁ <b>vā</b> passasanto rassaṁ passasāmīti pajānāti.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ <b>Or</b> when breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ <b>Or</b> when breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ <b>Or</b> when breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato#18.1">MN 118:18.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, one does not either know the breathing in or the breathing out. Rather, one first knows one, then the other, alternating between the two. Once again, the use of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> makes the point that the two actions do not happen simultaneously. To make the same point in English one would have to render the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as “and”, or one could simply drop it altogether:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of the above examples are exact parallels to the situation in the present <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> rule. In this rule we have eight factors, all of which need to be fulfilled, but not at the same time. Based on this precedent, and the explanation found in the Vibhaṅga, I believe it is only reasonable to render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as “and” also in Bi Pj 8.</p>
<p>Finally, I am told that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ca</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> are so similar in Sinhala characters that they are often confused when manuscripts are copied. In fact, this phenomenon is known to the commentaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For recently, in some places in the written book the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> is seen, but also the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ca</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-11' id='introduction-noteref-11' role='doc-noteref'>11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pācittiya</i> 54</h3>
<p>This rule is very similar to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pācittiya</i> 35, except for two things: (1) it uses the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> (“invited”) in place of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> (“eaten”); and (2), it adds a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i>, “or”, which at first glance seems out of place. Here are the two rules for easy reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a nun, who has been invited to a meal (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i>), refuses an offer to eat more (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>), and then eats fresh or cooked food, she commits an offense entailing confession.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-12' id='introduction-noteref-12' role='doc-noteref'>12</a> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali#1.20.1">Bi Pc 54</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a monk has finished his meal (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i>) and refused an invitation to eat more (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>), and then eats fresh or cooked food that is not left over, he commits an offense entailing confession.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali#2.15.1">Bu Pc 35</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The origin story to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali#1.1">Bi Pc 54</a> is practically identical to the one at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 35</a>, and in both stories the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> is used together with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i>. In the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i> rule, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> is then taken into the rule, but not in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> rule, where it is replaced by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i>. The significance of this difference, even whether there is one, is by no means clear.</p>
<p>One solution is to regard <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> as synonyms or near-synonyms. If so, then instead of two different situations in which the present rule is breached (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>), there is only one, which is what we have in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i> rule. Yet this is not quite satisfactory given the non-offense clause of Bi Pc 54, according to which there is no offense if you have been <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> but not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>.</p>
<p>An alternative solution is to understand <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as “and”, as it must in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī pārājika</i> 8, instead of as “or”. In fact, the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī commentary has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the fourth rule (that is, the present rule) <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> is to be understood by the method spoken of in the rule on group meals (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32/en/brahmali#8.15.1">Bu Pc 32</a>); and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i> is to be understood by the method spoken of in the rule on invitation (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali#2.15.1">Bu Pc 35</a>).<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-13' id='introduction-noteref-13' role='doc-noteref'>13</a></p>

<p>At Bu Pc 32, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantita</i> is used to signify that one has been invited to a meal. In contrast to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i>, it is not used to indicate an offer to eat specific foods. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nimantita</i> is thus something that happens before one arrives to a meal offering, whereas <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i>, as used in Bu Pc 35, indicates an offering of food into one’s hands, specifically a refusal of such food.</p>
<p>On this understanding the two words are not synonymous, but instead a sequence of actions. This fits with the non-offense clause of the present rule, where there is no offense if one has simply been invited, but <em>not</em> refused an offer to eat more (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali#2.2.7">Bi Pc 54:2.2.7</a>). Here the two actions are clearly separate. To bring this out in translation, however, necessitates rendering <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vā</i> as “and”, as in Bi Pj 8, for which see the discussion above. To my mind, this is the best solution to the present conundrum, and I translate accordingly.</p>
<p>It is not at all implausible that the difficulty with interpreting the present rule is a result of corruption. According to private communication from Ven. Vimalañāṇī, a number of the other schools of Buddhism have this rule as shared between the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunīs</i>, which means that the wording of the rules is the same. Specifically, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> rule has the equivalent of the Pali <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>, rather than <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>.</p>
<p>Here are the details for the individual schools as told by Ven. Vimalañāṇī. The Lokuttaravādins (extant text in Sanskrit), the Mahīśāsakas, and the Mūlasarvāstivādins (both with extant texts in Chinese) all have the equivalent of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> instead of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāritā</i>. For the Mahāsaṅghikas (extant text in Chinese), the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunīs</i> have a shared rule that is closer to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36/en/brahmali#1.28.1">Bi Pc 36</a> of the Pali, which again means that its reading would have been <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i>, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nimantitā</i>. For the Dharmaguptakas, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunīs</i> have a rule that is not held in common with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i>, but the reading of the Chinese once again suggests the original was <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i>. Given this strong preference for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhuttāvī</i> in all schools apart from the Pali, it seems quite possible that the Pali text has been corrupted.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī pācittiya</i> 81</h3>
<p>Here is the rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If, when a given consent has expired (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārivāsikachandadānena</i>), a nun gives the full admission to a trainee nun, she commits an offense entailing confession.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81/en/brahmali#1.13.1">Bi Pc 81</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main problem here is the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārivāsikachandadānena</i>. The latter part of the compound, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chandadānena</i>, most likely means, “by the giving of consent”, or “by the passing on of consent”, referring to the consent passed on by monastics who are not present at a legal procedure of the Sangha (see Bhikkhu Sujato, “Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies”, pp. 205–210). The first part of the compound, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārivāsika</i>, is trickier. This is what the commentaries say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, the monks are seated, thinking, “We will do a legal procedure, such as a rehabilitation, etc.,” but then a monk who is an expert in constellations says, “Today the constellations are inauspicious; don’t do this procedure.” Because of his statement, they withdraw their consent (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>chandaṁ vissajjetvā</i>), but remain seated. Then another monk arrives and says: “What is beneficial is lost for the fool who honors constellations. Why worry about constellations?” This is expired consent and expired intention. With this sort of outdatedness, if one does not convey consent and purity anew, it is not allowable to do the procedure.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-14' id='introduction-noteref-14' role='doc-noteref'>14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Chandaṁ vissajjetvā</i>: about this, it is said in the Anugaṇṭhipada: “This <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is not to be done today. Having said, ‘(Do it) at your convenience’, (the consent) is given …”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-15' id='introduction-noteref-15' role='doc-noteref'>15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This interpretation, however, seems strained and artificial. Consent is normally given by those who cannot be present at a particular meeting, not as suggested here, by an entire group of people who may or may not be present at an unspecified future meeting. I prefer to interpret this rule to refer to the consent that has been given prior to a particular ordination ceremony. If the ceremony is postponed—which is defined in the Vibhaṅga as the “assembly having risen” —then that consent is no longer valid for any new ceremony happening later. Renewed consent is required for the postponed ordination.</p>
<p>It would seem strange, however, to limit this regulation to ordination ceremonies. It is reasonable to think it should apply to all <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. We do, in fact, see indications of this elsewhere in the Vinaya Piṭaka. At Kd 2 and Kd 4 we find the following regulations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shouldn’t do the observance-day ceremony with a passed-on purity that has expired (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārivāsikapārisuddhidānena</i>), except if the gathering is still seated together.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#36.4.1">Kd 2:36.4.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shouldn’t do the invitation ceremony with a passed-on invitation that has expired (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārivāsikapavāraṇādānena</i>), except if the gathering is still seated together.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali#14.4.1">Kd 4:14.4.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two compounds here given in Pali are the same as the one we have discussed above, except that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chanda</i> is replaced by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārisuddhi</i> and by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> respectively. Both of these situations parallel what we have seen earlier, namely, that neither the observance-day ceremony not the invitation ceremony should be done if a previously given consent has expired, as explained above. Given three instances of the same principle applied to a variety of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, we can infer it pertains to all legal procedures.</p>
