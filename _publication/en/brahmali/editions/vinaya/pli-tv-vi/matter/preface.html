<h1>Preface and acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first absolutely complete translation from Pali into English of the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Monastic Law, of the Theravada school of Buddhism. This translation has been over ten years in the making, with the actual beginnings of the process no more than a hazy memory. When I started out, I had no clear sense that this would ever get published, and so it is especially satisfying to have reached this point.</p>
<p>The present translation is divided into six volumes, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Monks’ Pātimokkha rules and their analysis (Mahā-vibhaṅga), part I</li>
<li>The Monks’ Pātimokkha rules and their analysis (Mahā-vibhaṅga), part II</li>
<li>The Nuns’ Pātimokkha rules and their analysis (Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga)</li>
<li>The Chapters (Khandhakas), part I</li>
<li>The Chapters (Khandhakas), part II</li>
<li>The Compendium (Parivāra).<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a></li>
</ol>
<p>This translation is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti version (MS) of the Pali Canon as found on the website SuttaCentral.net. MS was created by the Dhamma Society of Thailand, and is essentially a corrected version of the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana Tipiṭaka, the official Theravada Tipiṭaka as produced at the Sixth Council in Burma. Sometimes the readings of MS were unclear or ambiguous, in which case I have consulted other versions of the Tipiṭaka, specifically the Siamrath Tipiṭaka (SRT) of Thailand, the Buddha Jayantī Tipiṭaka of Sri Lanka, and the Pali Text Society version (PTS). Whenever I depart from the readings of MS, I have recorded this in a footnote. Occasionally I have also consulted parallel texts in other languages, especially in the Āgama literature as preserved in Chinese. As to the commentaries and sub-commentaries, I have relied mostly on the VRI version available at tipitaka.org.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current translation has been to produce an accurate, clear, and accessible rendering of the Monastic Law into English. I have tried, throughout, to have the true users of the Vinaya in mind, that is, the monastics who live their lives according to these scriptures. To this end, I have attempted to make the text both meaningful and easy to read, with the objective of producing an easy-to-use guide that can readily be applied in one’s monastic life. I have endeavored to find a balance between formality and natural spoken language. My aim has been to give the reader a sense that the most important parts of the Vinaya Piṭaka consist of real teachings, often spoken by the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose has been to improve on I. B. Horner’s incomplete and at times inaccurate translation. Despite her admirable and careful work as a pioneer, Horner’s translation suffers from a number of shortcomings. Especially problematic is her failure to translate the more risqué parts of the Vinaya, of which there are quite a few. It so happens that these parts can be of critical importance to a monastic trying to understand the details of their training rules. Furthermore, Horner’s translation is often inaccurate, and occasionally outright wrong.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a> At times it is impossible to understand her renderings, giving the impression that she did not properly grasp the meaning of the underlying Pali.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a> I have tried to avoid such issues by always translating clearly, even in cases where the meaning was in doubt. In my view, it is better to translate meaningfully, even if sometimes wrongly, than to leave the reader bewildered. At least a text with a clear meaning can be duly criticized.</p>
<p>The Vinaya Piṭaka is a specialist’s corner of the Pali Canonical texts, and the readership will inevitably be limited. In fact, the Vinaya is really a kind of support literature, with the Suttas being at the core of the Buddhist tradition. Never mind, I shall rest content with the tiniest of readership. At least one person has already benefitted. May you enjoy it too!</p>
<hr>
<p>To ensure the quality of my translation, I have often compared my understanding of the Pali with that of my illustrious predecessors. In particular, I have consulted I. B. Horner’s pioneering translation, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>The Book of the Discipline</i> (BD). Despite often disagreeing with her renderings, I have learned much from her philological approach. Another important source has been Ajahn Ṭhānissaro’s work, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>The Buddhist Monastic Code I</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>II</i>, in which he makes a large number of corrections to I. B. Horner’s translation. Ven. Ñāṇatusita’s detailed <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Analysis of the Bhikkhu Pātimokkha</i> has been yet another important reference work. His detailed analysis of the Pātimokkha rules is a goldmine of information. I have also consulted Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translations “The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha”, “The Connected Discourses of the Buddha”, and, with Ven. Ñāṇamoli, “The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha”, as well as Ven. Ñāṇamoli’s “The Life of the Buddha”. Other works consulted are referenced in the footnotes.</p>
<p>During the long process of translating the Vinaya Piṭaka, I have received the kind and generous help of a number of people. First and foremost, I have benefitted from the unstinting support of my preceptor Ajahn Brahm, who first taught me both Vinaya and Pali. During a span of more than three decades, he has shown me how to combine an overarching view of the purpose of the Vinaya with an appreciation of minutiae and the legal nature of the text. Moreover, his pragmatic and compassionate approach to understanding the Vinaya makes it eminently relevant to modern monasticism. I never would have dared to undertake this enterprise without this ballast.</p>
<p>Then there is my good friend and sometimes mentor, Bhante Sujato, who is ultimately responsible for this whole project. It is truly astonishing what he has been able to achieve as an extended result of his work on SuttaCentral. Bhante Sujato has been a critical resource for everything from technical discussions to details of layout.</p>
<p>I have had a few indefatigable supporters whose intelligence and eye for detail have made this translation so much better. My main supporter has been Tracy Lau, now Ven. Nadī of Dhammasara Nuns Monastery, who has read through the entire manuscript at least three times, making innumerable corrections, suggestions, and observations. It’s a true blessing to have such dedicated and intelligent support over such a long period. Another important helper has been my co-monastic Ven. Mettavihāri of Australia who read through the present translation on two separate occasions. I am especially grateful for his grammatical corrections and his help in laying out the document in the appropriate way.</p>
<p>In the early stages of this project, a significant amount of work was done to match my translation line by line with the segmented Pali text on SuttaCentral. Four people in particular put a lot of effort into this task: Ven. Vimalā of the Netherlands, Ven. Sabbamittā of Germany, Ven. Nadī of Canada, and Tara Athan of the US. In addition, Ven. Vimalā has kindly shared their detailed research on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanakas</i> (for which see Appendix I: Technical Terms), whereas Ven. Sabbamittā has assisted with proofreading.</p>
<p>In addition to these major helpers, a number of others have lent their support in various ways. I have had several helpful discussions with Ven. Munissarā of Australia on a variety of technical points, while Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi helped with a tricky passage in the Parivāra. Ven. Dhammānando of England helped occasionally with difficult readings from the commentaries, and Ven. Sunyo of Australia made important suggestions for the introduction. Ven. Vimalañāṇī of Germany was especially helpful with looking up parallels in the Vinayas in Chinese translation, whereas Ven. Suvīrā of Australia helped me understand the nature of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅkacchika</i>. Other significant helpers include Ven. Khemaratana and Ven. Khemarato of the US, Ven. Karuṇikā of Australia, Ven. Abhayaratana of Canada, Ven. Vimutti of Australia, and Ven. Pāladhammika of the US. I must also mention Bryan Levman for our occasional discussions of Vinaya terminology. Finally, I am grateful for the help I have received from a large number of others, either indirectly by way of Vinaya discussions or directly as corrections or suggestions for changes to the manuscript.</p>
<p>To all of you, thank you for your invaluable support!</p>

<p>The meaning of these titles and the contents of each volume will be discussed in the General Introduction and the introductions to each volume. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>

<li epub:type='endnote' id='introduction-note-2'>
<p>A glaring example is her translation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> as “cell”, when it should be “yard”, that is, the area surrounding a building. Her rendering was perhaps influenced by the realities of medieval Christian monasticism. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type='endnote' id='introduction-note-3'>
<p>For instance, she renders the phrase <i translate='no' lang='pli'>anatthasaṁhite setughāto tathāgatānaṁ</i> as “bridge-breaking for Truth-finders is among what does not belong to the goal”, which is unintelligible. A proper understanding of the Pali leads to a rendering along the following lines: “Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial”. That is, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>setughāta</i>, which literally means “breaking the bridge”, needs to be understood metaphorically as conveying the inability to do certain actions. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>
