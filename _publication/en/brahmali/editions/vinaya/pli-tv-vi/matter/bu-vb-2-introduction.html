<p>The present volume is the second of six, the total of which comprises a complete translation of the Pali Vinaya Piṭaka, the Monastic Law, of the Theravada school of Buddhism. For a general introduction to the Monastic Law, see volume 1. In the present introduction, I will survey the contents of volume 2 and make observations of points of particular interest.</p>
<p>This volume contains the second and last part of the Bhikkhu-vibhaṅga, “the Monks’ Analysis”, the first part of which is contained in volume 1. Whereas the first volume contains the heavy offenses of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i>, also known as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garukāpatti</i>, the current volume contains the light offenses, or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>lahukāpatti</i>. These offenses are divided into the following classes:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> (NP), “the offenses entailing relinquishment and confession”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> (Pc), “the offenses entailing confession”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i> (Pd), “the offenses entailing acknowledgment”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> (Sk), “the rules of training”</li>
<li>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i>, or just <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> (As), “the principles for settling legal issues”.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-nissaggiya-pācittiyas-np">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> (NP)</h2>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> are offenses entailing relinquishment and confession. They concern cases where a monastic either acquires or uses a requisite in an inappropriate fashion, or acquires something altogether unallowable. The requisite in question then needs to be relinquished before the offense is confessed. There is no further penalty. A curious detail is that the relinquished requisites must be returned to the offender, except if the item is altogether unallowable for a monastic, as in the case of money, gold, or gems. The point of this largely ceremonial relinquishment might be to make the rule stick better in memory. Not returning a relinquished item is itself an offense. In total there are thirty such rules for the monks.</p>
<p>The majority of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiya</i> rules, in total 23 out of 30, concern cloth, cloth requisites, or thread for such requisites. Of the remaining seven rules, there are two rules about bowls, one about medicinal tonics, one concerned with diverting requisites meant for the Sangha, one about money, and finally two about trading. In what follows I will briefly note a few points of interest drawn from the current chapter.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali#2.39.1">Bu NP 2</a> the rule includes the expression “except if the monks have agreed”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aññatra bhikkhusammutiya</i>, which is then explained in the word commentary using the synonymous expression <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ṭhapetvā bhikkhusammutiṁ</i>. It is only in the origin story that this is specified as a legal procedure of one motion and one announcement. We find a similar situation in a number of other rules. This gives the impression that the “agreement of the monks” initially was an informal process that over time got formalized as a specific legal procedure. This also points to the word commentaries being older than the origin stories.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu NP 5</a> we find the touching case of a compassionate criminal who makes an offering to the nun Uppalavaṇṇā by hanging some meat from a branch, announcing in her presence that this is offered to any monastic who sees it. She takes the meat, has it prepared, and takes it to the Buddha. At no point is the meat offered into her hands. One is left with a sense that giving to a monastic was quite informal in the earliest period. It is also noteworthy what she says to the monk Udāyī, namely, that it is hard for women to get material support. Some things have not changed much since the time of the Buddha.</p>
<p>In the rule formulation to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np7/en/brahmali#1.31.1">Bu NP 7</a>, we find the phrase “that monk”, referring to the monk in the previous rule, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali#2.18.1">Bu NP 6</a>. This sort of direct connection between the rules shows unmistakably that at an earlier time the Pātimokkha must have existed as a separate text, presumably going back to a time when the Vibhaṅga did not yet exist.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a> <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Bu NP 10</a>, the longest rule of the Bhikkhu-pātimokkha, includes a full description of how to establish and use a fund set up for the benefit of a monastic, which makes it much more than just a training rule. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np15/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu NP 15</a> starts with the striking story of the monk Upasena who visits the Buddha while the latter is on retreat. It turns out that the local Sangha has laid down a rule that anyone who visits the Buddha commits a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> offense. Upasena expresses his disapproval of this and is supported by the Buddha. This reinforces the message of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta that the Sangha should not add new rules or remove existing ones, but should practice according to what has been laid down by the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.6.13">DN 16:1.6.13</a>).</p>
<p>At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali#1.28.1">Bu NP 18</a> we find the rule against a monastic accepting gold or silver, which is then defined as money in the word commentary. This rule is significant because the Buddha elsewhere warns about the danger of money for a monastic (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Kd 22:1.3.1</a>–1.5.1). At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np23/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu NP 23</a>, we have the extraordinary story of Pilindavaccha who uses his psychic powers to turn a pad of grass into a golden garland and then does the same with the king’s house. The same story is found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#15.1.1">Kd 6</a>, in which Pilindavaccha appears a number of times. He also appears in a case study at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.47.1">Bu Pj 2</a>. Interestingly, although he was clearly an inspiring monk one might expect to encounter in the four main Nikāyas, he is not mentioned there at all except for a single and probably late occurrence at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.209%E2%80%93218/en/brahmali#1.1">AN 1.215</a>. This is yet another indication that much of the Vinaya Piṭaka does not belong to the earliest period of Buddhism.</p>
<h2 id="the-pācittiyas-pc">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> (Pc)</h2>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i>, “the offenses entailing confession”, are the largest class of rules in the monks’ Pātimokkha, numbering in total 92. There is no penalty for committing these offenses apart from the confession itself. The confession formula, which is found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#27.1.8">Kd 2:27.1.8</a>–27.1.14, involves recognizing that one has committed an offense and undertaking restraint for the future. The severity of committing a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> offense is illustrated through a simile at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato#3.1">AN 4.244</a>, which compares it to being struck on the head with a sack of ashes.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a></p>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> are classed as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khuddaka</i>, that is, minor offenses, and are called by this name at the end of the chapter. This is interesting, for it sheds light on expressions such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khuddānukhuddaka</i>,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a> which must then be a reference to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> and perhaps other offenses of even lesser importance. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> chapter is divided into nine subchapters with ten rules each, except for the penultimate subchapter which has twelve.</p>
<p>The first subchapter begins with the fundamental moral rule against lying (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc1/en/brahmali#1.20.1">Bu Pc 1</a>), followed by a rule against verbal abuse (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/brahmali#1.2.1">Bu Pc 2</a>), which includes a retelling of the Nandivisāla Jātaka, number 28 of that collection. The Vibhaṅga to this rule shows that at the time of the Buddha, or shortly thereafter, India was already a society divided by caste, name, and occupation. This rule is also an example of a tendency I mentioned earlier of monastic victims of misconduct being better protected by the Vinaya than lay victims. There is a full offense of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> for abusing another monastic, but just <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa</i> (an offense of wrong conduct) for abusing a lay person. The same difference in offense is also found for the next rule, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3/en/brahmali#2.3.4">Bu Pc 3</a>, as well as for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc13/en/brahmali#3.2.3.">Bu Pc 13</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8/en/brahmali#1.2.26.1">Bu Pc 8</a> is an notable rule that prohibits monastics from telling lay people about their own superhuman qualities, including deep meditations, deep insights, and psychic powers. According to the origin story, monks told lay people of their superhuman qualities in order to receive sufficient food during a famine. Although the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i> regard psychic powers as a testimony to one’s spiritual development, they are mostly a private concern. For instance, the Buddha compares showing off psychic powers for the sake of material support to a sex worker showing her private parts for the sake of money (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#8.2.15">Kd 15:8.2.15</a>–8.2.18). In the Kevaddha Sutta, the Buddha takes this one step further (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#5.7">DN 11:5.7</a>). In the context of using psychic powers to strengthen people’s faith, he says that he detests and abhors them. This is very strong language coming from the Buddha, who normally tends to be understated. He explains his attitude by saying that people without confidence will simply dismiss such powers as a magic trick. The overall point seems to be that talking about any of these things to lay people tends to cheapen them, which is the opposite of what one should try to achieve.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc10/en/brahmali#1.16.1">Bu Pc 10</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc11/en/brahmali#1.29.1">Bu Pc 11</a> prohibit a monastic from digging the earth or destroying vegetation. The origin stories to both rules tell of lay people complaining that monastics were destroying life with one sense faculty. In other words, the earth and plants were regarded by the general population, or at least some people, as having a rudimentary form of sentience. The Buddha seems to dismiss this as superstition, saying, “People regard the earth/trees as conscious”, but nevertheless lays down a rule, apparently to satisfy the lay people. Interestingly, the issue of whether plants, especially, are conscious is never finally resolved, for the Buddha never makes an explicit statement either way. What we can say, however, is that either action was considered a minor issue. The Vibhaṅga to both these rules allows monastics to give broad hints if they need a hole in the ground or vegetation removed. The remaining rules in the second subchapter mostly concern proper conduct in relation to dwellings and furniture.</p>
<p>Subchapter three concerns the relationship between monks and nuns. A significant aspect of this relationship is that the monks have a duty to give a half-monthly instruction to the nuns. To ensure the quality of this instruction, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21/en/brahmali#1.44.1">Bu Pc 21</a> lays down that an instructing monk has to be appointed by the Sangha and meet a set of minimum standards, which include good moral conduct, detailed knowledge of both Pātimokkhas, and 20 years of seniority. Most of the remaining rules in this subchapter prohibit various inappropriate interactions between monks and nuns, including being together in private.</p>
<p>Subchapter four is all about food. It is here that we find the rule that a monastic can only eat between dawn and noon, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/brahmali#1.22.1">Bu Pc 37</a>, and that they cannot store food, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc38/en/brahmali#1.18.1">Bu Pc 38</a>. Both of these rules are fundamental to how the monastic life works, in that they make it necessary for monastics and their lay supporters to have daily contact. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali#2.10.1">Bu Pc 39</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37/en/brahmali#2.10.1">Sk 37</a> prohibit a monastic from asking for specific foods. A monastic is supposed to be content with whatever they receive. The last rule of this subchapter prohibits a monastic from eating anything that has not been given.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc44/en/brahmali#1.14.1">Bu Pc 44</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45/en/brahmali#1.14.1">Bu Pc 45</a> prohibit a monastic from being alone with someone of the opposite gender, rules that can be surprisingly important to sustain the monastic life. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc67/en/brahmali#1.28.1">Bu Pc 67</a> is of the same sort. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47/en/brahmali#1.4.27.1">Bu Pc 47</a>, which allows a monastic to ask a lay person for requisites if invited beforehand, is another ever-relevant rule that governs the relationship between monastics and lay people. The offense is incurred when the monastic goes beyond the limits of the invitation. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc48/en/brahmali#2.13.1">Bu Pc 48</a>–50 place strict limits on monastics’ visit to the military. This is in keeping with the fundamentally non-violent nature of Buddhism, especially monasticism.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/brahmali#1.1">Bu Pc 51</a> opens with the entertaining story of a monk fighting a battle with a dragon, the details of which are similar to the story of the Buddha at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#15.3.1">Kd 1:15.3.1</a>–15.4.3. At a later time, the same monk becomes so drunk that he collapses and has to be carried back to the monastery by his fellow monastics. The Buddha remarks that this previously powerful monk would now be unable to fight even a lizard! He then lays down the rule against drinking alcohol. Not drinking alcohol is a fundamental aspect of the monastic life (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.50/en/sujato">AN 4.50</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/brahmali#1.16.1">Bu Pc 61</a> prohibits a monastic from killing living beings, another fundamental aspect of Buddhist morality. Apart from the present rule and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> 3, there are several other rules that also concern the killing of living beings, such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc20/en/brahmali#1.12.1">Bu Pc 20</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc62/en/brahmali#1.11.1">Bu Pc 62</a>, and indirectly <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np11/en/brahmali#1.23.1">Bu NP 11</a>. Other acts of physical violence are covered by rules such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc74/en/brahmali#1.15.1">Bu Pc 74</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc75/en/brahmali#1.15.1">Bu Pc 75</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63/en/brahmali#1.12.1">Bu Pc 63</a> is one among a number of rules that concern legal issues (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇas</i>) and their resolution through legal procedures (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>), all of which are principal topics of the Khandhakas. Other rules that directly concern the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> are <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc79/en/brahmali#1.22.1">Bu Pc 79</a>–81. Many more rules use <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> to fulfill their purpose, such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali#1.3.16.1">Bu Ss 10</a>–13, the four rules that include the phrase “except if the monks have agreed”,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-4' id='introduction-noteref-4' role='doc-noteref'>4</a> and assorted other rules. As we will see in the introduction to the Khandhakas in volume 4, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is fundamental to the workings of monasticism as an institution.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali#1.23.1">Bu Pc 64</a> prohibits a monk from concealing another monk’s grave offense. Monasticism is an honor system that relies on trust. If the trust is broken, the whole system starts to fall apart. For this reason, it is important that significantly bad behavior is rooted out as soon as possible. For the nuns, concealing a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense is itself a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali#1.23.1">Bi Pj 6</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali#1.53.1">Bu Pc 65</a> sets the age limit for the full ordination of men at 20. The offense is committed by the act of ordaining a man below this age. (I will discuss the rules for the ordination of women in the introduction to the Nuns’ Analysis in volume 3.) As one might expect, ordination is an important topic in the Vinaya Piṭaka, with the longest <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i>, Kd 1, devoted to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68/en/brahmali#1.49.1">Bu Pc 68</a>–70 concern the wrong view that sexual intercourse is not an obstacle on the spiritual path. Such views are heavily censured in the Vinaya Piṭaka. The initial offense is one of confession under Bu Pc 68, but for anyone who refuses to relinquish such a view the final result is ejection from the Sangha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/brahmali#32.1.1">Kd 11:32.1.1</a>). Again, it is striking how the Buddha’s view of sensuality is so at odds with the way it tends to be celebrated in regular society.</p>
<p>The origin story to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali#1.3.56.1">Bu Pc 83</a>, the first rule of the ninth and last subchapter, includes a long section on the dangers of entering a royal compound, which is a parallel to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.45/en/sujato">AN 10.45</a>. It is essentially a warning against getting too close to power, a very real problem for some monastics, both ancient and modern. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84/en/brahmali#3.17.1">Bu Pc 84</a> prohibits a monastic from picking up valuables, which, besides money, precious metals, and gems, include anything people regard as valuable or useful. The only exception is safekeeping. This is one of only two instances where a monastic is allowed to pick up money, the other being if they have been chosen as a “discarder of money” under <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali#2.36">Bu NP 18</a> or <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np19/en/brahmali#2.46">Bu NP 19</a>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85/en/brahmali#4.9.1">Bu Pc 85</a> prohibits monks from entering an inhabited area at the wrong time, that is, any time after noon until the following dawn. This shows that monks in the early period lived exclusively outside of inhabited areas. The nuns, who were not permitted to live in the wilderness, do not have this rule.</p>
<p>The remainder of the rules in subchapter nine concern requisites that are inappropriate for monastics, including rules on the proper size for cloth requisites. It is here, especially, that we meet with the idea of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sugata</i> is normally an epithet of the Buddha, meaning something like “the one who has gone to a good destination”, but here seems to be used in the sense of “standard” measures. See the Appendix I: Technical Terms for further discussion.</p>
<h2 id="the-pāṭidesanīyas-pd">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i> (Pd)</h2>
<p>The next class of offenses is known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i>, “offenses entailing acknowledgment”. These, too, are clearable by confession, but the formula to be used is different from that of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i>. The monks have four such offenses.</p>
<p>It is not clear why there are two separate classes of offenses both entailing confession, that is, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiyas</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i>. According to the similes at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato#4.1">AN 4.244</a>, the committing of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīya</i> offense is equivalent to wearing black and submitting oneself to the wishes of a crowd. The committing a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> offense, as we have seen, is compared to being beaten with a sack of ashes, and so it would seem that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> offenses are regarded as the more serious. Still, it is hard to see that there is any systematic difference between the two classes. Perhaps the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i> were an early class of offenses that was later abandoned as unnecessary, which may explain why there are so few of them. The unusual formula of confession might perhaps be a remnant from a time when the standard formula of confession had not yet been laid down. Yet, abolishing the class in toto was presumably not practical since the monks were already practicing the existing rules.</p>
<p>The first two of the four involve the nuns. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1/en/brahmali#1.35.1">Bu Pd 1</a> prohibits a monk from receiving almsfood from a nun within an inhabited area. Again, this shows how difficult it could be for women to find support in their practice of the monastic life. Here and elsewhere, such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu NP 5</a>, the monks are required to be sensitive to the needs of the nuns. In confessing this offense, and also the last two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāṭidesanīyas</i>, a monk is required to say that “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”</p>
<p><a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2/en/brahmali#1.15.1">Bu Pd 2</a> concerns nuns ordering lay people to give food to specific monks. The offense is incurred if the monks do nothing to stop such a nun. The confession formula to this rule is unique and involves the monks confessing together: “We have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it.” <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3/en/brahmali#3.15.1">Bu Pd 3</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4/en/brahmali#2.12.1">Bu Pd 4</a> concern unusual circumstances that are unlikely to occur in practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-sekhiyas-sk">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> (Sk)</h2>
<p>The second last class of offenses is known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>, “rules of training”. There is no automatic offense for breaking these rules, but an offense of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa</i> if broken out of disrespect. There are 75 such rules. They are the same for the monks and the nuns.</p>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> are mostly about etiquette and as such about what was considered socially appropriate in India 2,500 years ago. For this reason, it is convenient that these rules are only offended against when broken out of disrespect. In practice, this means that circumstances such as the prevailing social norms may be taken into account in deciding whether a rule needs to be followed or not. An obvious example is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk70/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Sk 70</a>, which prohibits a monastic from teaching while standing if the audience is sitting. This rule does not fit the modern practice of speakers standing in the presence of their audience, as in the case of a talk given in an auditorium. In such circumstances one can reasonably argue that this <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rule does not apply. Similar considerations apply for a large number of these rules. It follows that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> have a lower status than the other classes of rules. It is no doubt for this reason that it was considered acceptable to add new <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> to the Pātimokkha after the time of the Buddha, as we have discussed in the introduction to volume 1. Nevertheless, even these added rules often draw on material found elsewhere in the Vinaya or the Suttas, and as such may well stem from the earliest period.</p>
<p>That the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> draw on material that exists elsewhere is especially obvious in the case of 55 of the first 56 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>, which are found in similar form in Kd 18.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-5' id='introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-noteref'>5</a> The question then arises of where they are likely to have appeared first. Normally, in the Khandhakas, when someone is depicted as breaking a Pātimokkha rule, the rule is simply referred to, which means one needs to look it up in the Vibhaṅga. This is not the case for these <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules, which suggests they did not exist in the Vibhaṅga at the time they were laid down in Kd 18. Moreover, the wording in Kd 18 is simpler than the wording in the Vibhaṅga, which includes the refrain <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sikkhā karaṇīyā</i>, “a training to be done”, for every <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i>. This too suggests a movement from the Khandhakas to the Vibhaṅga. Lastly, most of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules have artificially created origin stories, with all of them except three featuring the group of six monks. This suggests that they were not really independent rules with separate origin stories, but rather part of a general description of right conduct with a single origin story, which is what we find in the Khandhakas (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd18/en/brahmali#4.2.1">Kd 18:4.2.1</a>). And indeed, this single origin story does feature the group of six monks, which then, presumably, got distributed to all the origin stories of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> 1–56, with the exception of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk51/en/brahmali#1.1">Sk 51</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk55/en/brahmali#1.1">Sk 55</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk56/en/brahmali#1.1">Sk 56</a>.</p>
<p>A brief review of the correspondence tables in Pachow’s comparative study of the Bhikkhu-pātimokkha suggests to me that the rules of the different schools are more closely aligned for the last 19 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> than for the first 56. This is especially so if we remove <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk65/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Sk 65</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk68/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Sk 68</a>, which are not attested in many of the non-Pali schools.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-6' id='introduction-noteref-6' role='doc-noteref'>6</a> If this is correct, and given the possibility that many of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> may have been moved from the Khandhakas to the Vibhaṅga, it may be that the remaining 17 rules, more or less, are the original common core around which the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i> developed as a chapter. A number of these rules do in fact have a word commentary, which is rare among the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>. This too suggests that they developed as independent rules and were not merely transplanted from elsewhere.</p>
<p>As to the content of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>, the first 26 concern the proper behavior when walking for alms and sitting in inhabited areas. The next 30 rules lay down the proper conduct and etiquette in relation to eating. We then have 16 rules on not teaching anyone not showing appropriate respect. The last three rules are about spitting and toilet etiquette.</p>
<p>Despite the general homogeneity in the Vibhaṅga material of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>, there are occasional points of interest. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk51/en/brahmali#1.1">Sk 51</a>, a monk makes a joke when he hears the slurping of his fellow monks, upon which the Buddha lays down a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa</i> offense for joking about the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha. This is not, however, a general rule against joking, with the Buddha himself occasionally making humorous remarks. In the origin story to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69/en/brahmali#1.12.1">Sk 69</a>, we find a Jātaka story, the Chavaka Jātaka, number 309 of that collection.</p>
<h2 id="the-adhikaraṇasamathadhammas-as">The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i> (As)</h2>
<p>The final class consists of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i>, “the principles for settling legal issues”. As I have pointed out in the introduction to volume 1, these principles stand out as not fitting very well with the other rules of the Pātimokkha, which are all rules about individual conduct. These seven principles, in contrast, are regulations to be used by the Sangha to resolve legal issues that may arise in the monastic community.</p>
<p>It is not just the nature of these principles that are different from the rest of the Pātimokkha rules, but also their presentation. There is virtually no <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> material, with the seven principles presented as little more than seven key words, not very different from an index. It is impossible to understand even the meaning of these principles from these key words alone, let alone how they are to be applied to resolve legal issues. For this reason, we are compelled to assume that this section must have been much longer earlier on, with the explanatory <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> material eventually moved as the Vinaya expanded and became unwieldy.</p>
<p>In the earliest period, this explanatory material may have looked like the exposition we now find in the Sāmagāma Sutta, where we see a succinct explanation of these principles.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-7' id='introduction-noteref-7' role='doc-noteref'>7</a> In addition to this, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> may have been the container for the various <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i> that must have been laid down early on, such as the observance-day ceremony, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, and the ordination ceremony. Over time, as the Vinaya developed, it would have been impractical to keep all this material as part of the Pātimokkha or even the Vibhaṅga. A whole new section was then created, which became the Khandhakas. The material specific to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> was collected in a purpose-made chapter, now known as the Samatha-kkhandhaka, that is, the Chapter on the Settling of Legal issues (Kd 14). Other material, such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i>, was distributed, as appropriate, in specially created chapters. Over time, more material would have been added. The end result of this process is the twenty-two Khandhakas as we have them now. I will discuss this process further in my introduction to part I of the Khandhakas in volume 4.</p>
<p>We may speculate as to why a mere list of these principles was retained in the Pātimokkha. It could be that the number of rules was regarded as fixed and should not be changed. Or it could be that this bridge between the Pātimokkha and the Khandhakas was considered useful. Whatever the case may be, we now have a reasonable explanation for why we only have a stub of these principles left in the Pātimokkha itself.</p>
<p>Further discussion of the seven <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathas</i> is found in the introduction to part II of the Khandhakas in volume 5.</p>

<p>At present the two Pātimokkhas of Theravada Buddhism are only found among the sub-commentaries, where they are included in a text called the Dvemātikāpāḷi. It is interesting that it has the suffix <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāḷi</i>, which indicates its provenance as a Canonical text. At some point the two Pātimokkhas must have been moved to their present position in the sub-commentaries. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>
