<p>The present volume is the fourth of six, the total of which constitutes a complete translation of the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Monastic Law. This volume consists of the first part of the Khandhakas, also known as the Mahāvagga, “the Great Division”, comprising the first 10 of altogether 22 chapters. The remaining 12 chapters, which will make up volume 5, are collectively known as the Cullavagga, “the Small Division”. In the present introduction, I will survey the contents of volume 4 and make observations of points of particular interest. For a general introduction to the Monastic Law, see volume 1.</p>
<p>The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> is derived from the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandha</i>, “an aggregate” or “a collection”, which is a core doctrinal term familiar from the Suttas, as in the phrase “the five aggregates”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khandhaka</i> is thus “a collection”. To refer to these collections as a group, I either use the Pali term Khandhakas or I render it into English as “the Chapters”. Other schools of Buddhism sometimes use the terms <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vastu</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pakiṇṇaka</i>, “subject matter”/“account” or “miscellaneous matters”, instead of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a></p>
<p>The splitting of the Khandhakas into two divisions, the Mahāvagga and the Cullavagga, is peculiar to the Pali tradition and encountered mostly in the sub-commentaries. It is not part of the common Buddhist heritage. As with the Sutta-vibhaṅga, this split is probably an artifact of the manuscript tradition, which needed to divide the text into chunks suitable for binding.</p>
<p>While the Sutta-vibhaṅga, contained in the first three volumes of this series, is divided into one part for monks and another for nuns, the Khandhakas are the same for both Sanghas, except for certain areas where the nuns have their own rules, especially as reflected in the Bhikkhunī-kkhandhaka.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a> We will take a closer look at the Bhikkhuni-kkhandhaka, Kd 20, in the introduction to volume 5.</p>
<p>Before we discuss some general features of the Khandhakas, here is a brief overview of their main contents. Whereas the Sutta-vibhaṅga concerns the Pātimokkha rules and their analysis, at the core of the Khandhakas are the regulations that govern Sangha meetings and decision making. And while the Sutta-vibhaṅga is quite homogenous, with a regular and predictable structure, the Khandhakas are more diverse. Apart from the regulations that govern Sangha meetings, the Khandhakas include a large number of stories, many of them featuring some of the best-loved personalities of early Buddhism, and a great number of minor rules dealing with everything from building regulations to personal grooming. Another significant part of the Khandhakas is the extended Buddha biography and the related accounts of the first two Councils. I shall return to this latter point shortly.</p>

<h2 id="the-origin-of-the-khandhakas">The origin of the Khandhakas</h2>
<p>The Khandhakas did not exist as a separate part of the Vinaya Piṭaka from the earliest period. I have argued in the introduction to volume 1 that initially there was only a Pātimokkha, whereas the Vinaya Piṭaka as a class of literature only arose later. This is evident from the fact that the Pātimokkha is mentioned with relative frequency in the Suttas, while the Khandhakas are not mentioned at all.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a> In the four main Nikāyas, even the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> mostly refers to training in a general sense, not to a separate collection of scriptures, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭaka</i>.</p>
<p>This suggestion is reinforced by the story of the first <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i> or Council. According to the account at Kd 21, Mahākassapa, who presides at the meeting, first asks Upāli about the Vinaya and then Ānanda about the Suttas. After asking Upāli about the four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offences for monks, the rest of the recitation is abbreviated with the following phrase: “In this way he asked about the analyses of both Monastic Codes.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-4' id='introduction-noteref-4' role='doc-noteref'>4</a> There is no mention of the Khandhakas.</p>
<p>Despite this absence of the Khandhakas as a collection, some of its content must have existed from the earliest period of Buddhism. The Pātimokkha rules themselves imply further rules and regulations. These include confession formulas for the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pācittiya</i> offenses, details about the process of emerging from <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offenses, false accusations (Bu Ss 8 and 9), dealing with monastics holding wrong views (Bu Pc 68–70), and resolving disagreements about the Dhamma. Beyond this are such important and fundamental rituals as the ordination ceremony and the observance day, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, which are mentioned throughout the Sutta Piṭaka. Much of this must have come into existence soon after the Buddha founded the monastic community. But if this is so, where were these laid down? Among which scriptures were these procedures that form the backbone of a functioning Sangha kept? I believe the answer, for the most part, is the Pātimokkha itself.</p>
<p>We have seen in the introduction to volume 2 that the Pātimokkha, both of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunīs</i>, includes a section of seven rules called the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhikaraṇasamathadhammas</i>, “the principles for settling legal issues”. I pointed out that these seven principles were used by the community as a whole in resolving problems and dealing with business, rather than being rules to be followed by individual members of the Sangha. What is especially striking about them is that they are presented without any analysis or explanation. This is in contrast to all the other rules included in the Pātimokkha. In fact, the way they are now listed in the Pātimokkha, it is impossible to know what they refer to or how they should be applied. An analysis, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i>, must have existed at some point. My proposal is that this missing analysis was removed from the Pātimokkha, either to be included in the Khandhakas or to form the kernel around which the Khandhakas grew.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-5' id='introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-noteref'>5</a></p>
<p>If the core of the Khandhakas as we have them now originated as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> to the seven principles for settling legal issues, what might this original analysis have looked like? Fortunately, we have a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i>, MN 104, that gives a brief description of the seven principles. It seems reasonable to assume that an early <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> would have looked much like this, with either the Sutta being a precursor to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> or the two being roughly contemporaneous. If so, what does this tell us?</p>
<p>The description at MN 104 focuses largely on how to deal with offenses, with five of the seven being concerned with this.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-6' id='introduction-noteref-6' role='doc-noteref'>6</a> They are thus closely tied to the Pātimokkha rules, and it makes sense that they would be found as an addition to them. The remaining two, however, concern disputes about the Dhamma and how these should be resolved harmoniously.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-7' id='introduction-noteref-7' role='doc-noteref'>7</a> It is not immediately obvious why these would be part of the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>It is these latter two rules above all, in my opinion, that show that the Pātimokkha is more than a set of rules binding on individuals. We are now moving into the sphere of regulating the Sangha as a functioning community. Dealing with disagreements about the Dhamma is an obvious example of this.</p>
<p>As I have mentioned above, however, there is more, including the important functions of the Sangha such as ordination and the observance-day ceremony. Where were the blueprints for these and other rituals kept? One possibility is that they were part of the first of the seven principles, “resolution face-to-face”. This principle is essentially about the Sangha coming together and doing whatever business is on the agenda. In other words, the most basic meaning of “face-to-face” is being in the presence of the Sangha.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-8' id='introduction-noteref-8' role='doc-noteref'>8</a> And so, the process for carrying out these important functions may have been set out under this principle.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-9' id='introduction-noteref-9' role='doc-noteref'>9</a> If so, then the Pātimokkha is beginning to look like much more than a simple set of rules.</p>
<p>Given such a development, it is easy to see how the first of the seven principles would have become bulky and unwieldy from early on.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-10' id='introduction-noteref-10' role='doc-noteref'>10</a> An ordination ceremony would have been required soon after the Sangha was formed, as can be seen from the exposition at Kd 1. Over time this ceremony developed into a long procedure. The same is true of other legal procedures, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i>, that are adumbrated in the Pātimokkha rules, such as the procedures related to the emergence from <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> offenses. The observance-day ceremony required rules for its implementation, as did the invitation ceremony, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, and much more. As all this was added to the Pātimokkha, specifically to the first of the seven principles, it would not be long before this section became overloaded and disjointed because of its varied content. It would then be natural to create a separate section for all the new and evolving Vinaya material. It is in this way that I envisage the creation of the Khandhakas.</p>
<p>What about the structure of the Khandhakas? It was no doubt natural to divide the diverse content into fairly homogenous topics. Moreover, as new material was added, it would either be an expansion of an existing topic, in which case it would go into the relevant section, usually at the end of it, or it would be added as a new chapter at the end of the Khandhakas. In this way, the material would have a roughly chronological sequence.</p>
<p>If we consider the Khandhakas as we have them now, this is essentially what we find. They start with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> on ordination, for ordination would have been required from the very beginning. Without ordination, there is no Sangha to which the rules in the Khandhakas can apply. Once there was a Sangha, there would be a need for occasional meetings and also a connection with the lay supporters. Such meetings were to be held on the observance day, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, an ancient Indian institution.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-11' id='introduction-noteref-11' role='doc-noteref'>11</a> These meetings were the seed from which the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> developed. Then there was the need to remain in one place during the rainy season, a practice already undertaken by ascetics of other religions. There would have been pressure from society on the evolving Buddhist Sangha to follow such precedents. The rainy-season residence is the topic of the third <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i>. This is followed by the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> on the invitation ceremony, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, which was to be performed at the end of the rainy season. The invitation ceremony fulfills the important function of opening oneself up for correction by one’s fellow monastics.</p>
<p>We could carry on this exercise for all the 22 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i>. For some of them, it is not obvious that they have a particular temporal position, yet the idea of a chronological sequence does seem to form the overarching principle on which they were laid down. The last of the 22 concerns the second Council, an event that is also historically the last.</p>
<p>The content of the individual <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i> suggests a similar temporal development. They often start with the laying down of a fundamental principle, followed by the most basic rules and regulations that relate to it. Then we have one or more stories, sometimes none, which usually serve as the background for further rules. Each <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> often ends with a rather theoretical series of permutations, often of limited practical significance. We will consider each <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> in more detail, including their temporal position in the series, as we discuss them individually below.</p>
<p>To complete the picture of the origin of the Khandhakas, there is one more issue that needs to be considered. As you start to read the Khandhakas, it is striking that they do not start with the laying down of rules, but with an extended biography of the Buddha’s post-awakening experiences. At the conclusion of the Khandhakas, in Kd 21 and 22, we find material of a similar sort, namely, aspects of the history of the Sangha after the Buddha had passed away. How can we explain the inclusion of this material?</p>
<p>We know that Buddha biographies started to appear in earnest after the Buddha passed away. All the schools of Buddhism whose scriptures we still possess had them.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-12' id='introduction-noteref-12' role='doc-noteref'>12</a> In the Pali tradition, the most developed and well-known of these stories is found in the introduction to the Jātaka stories, the so-called Jātaka-nidāna. As these stories started to form, the question would have arisen where to keep them. Being narratives created by an unknown person or community, they do not fit with the Suttas, which are generally the words of the Buddha. In fact, the biographical narrative in Kd 1 is not too different from the short narratives that introduce each Sutta, that is, narratives that give basic information about where the Buddha was staying and who he was speaking to. It might have been natural, then, to use the new biography in the same way. This is how I suppose it became the introduction to the entire Khandhaka literature.</p>
<p>There is another important reason this framing makes good sense. The early biography of the Buddha would have coincided with the early development of the Sangha. As the Buddha started teaching and getting a monastic following, rules and regulations for the Sangha would gradually be required. Throughout his life, the Buddha laid down such rules and regulations, which makes the Buddha biography a natural container for the entire Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<p>At an early point in the creation of the Khandhakas, it is plausible that the Buddha’s biography would have formed a continuous narrative into which all the rules and regulations of the Sangha found their natural place. As the material expanded, however, this natural structure broke down. Still, even now we see glimpses of the Buddha’s life throughout the Khandhakas. Eventually the Buddha dies. The last two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i> are therefore concerned with the preservation of the Vinaya in the period after his demise.</p>
<p>Yet there is a curious gap in this biography, especially as we have it in the Pali tradition. The important events surrounding the Buddha’s death, and the time leading up to it, are not mentioned. This is in spite of the fact that these events contain important guidelines for how the Vinaya should be regarded and practiced after the Buddha is gone.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out by the likes of Frauwallner that the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DN 16) fits quite naturally with the biographical and historical material of the Khandhakas. A curious detail about Kd 21, which begins immediately after the death of the Buddha, is that it starts quite abruptly: “Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the monks …”, followed by Mahākassapa telling of the events that are narrated toward the end of DN 16. Nowhere else in the Suttas or the Vinaya does a separate section or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> begin with the words <i translate='no' lang='pli'>atha kho</i>, “then”. The Pali <i translate='no' lang='pli'>atha kho</i> functions in a similar way to “then” in English, in that it connects the narrative to some previous event. It is unnatural to start a new section in this way without any relation to a preceding narrative. The sense one gets is that this originally was part of DN 16, or vice versa, forming an extended narrative. In fact, this is exactly what we find in the Vinayas of the Mūlasarvāstivādins and the Mahāsaṅghikas.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-13' id='introduction-noteref-13' role='doc-noteref'>13</a></p>
<p>DN 16 is, in fact, quite an anomalous Sutta. The Suttas are almost universally presented as the word of the Buddha with a short narrative framework. DN 16, by contrast, is essentially the opposite, that is, a narrative incorporating the word of the Buddha at various points, sometimes very briefly. Also, it is much longer than any other <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> in the four main Nikāyas, being almost twice the length of the next longest <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-14' id='introduction-noteref-14' role='doc-noteref'>14</a> Finally, DN 16 includes material that was composed after the Buddha’s passing, making it approximately contemporaneous with Kd 21. These considerations, combined with its close affiliation with Kd 21, suggests it was originally not part of the Suttas, but existed separately as an evolving biography of the Buddha. In some schools of early Buddhism this biography was broken up, with parts of it becoming DN 16 or its equivalent, whereas the remainder became the framework for the Khandhakas.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-15' id='introduction-noteref-15' role='doc-noteref'>15</a> For other schools the story was kept entirely within the Khandhakas.</p>
<p>In sum, it seems the Khandhakas were created in the period soon after the Buddha’s passing away, incorporating various elements from an evolving tradition. These elements included the Vibhaṅga material from the seven principles for settling legal issues, the various Sangha procedures and ceremonies that had been established either as separate documents or as part the seven principles, and finally the evolving Buddha biography. This core would then have evolved as new material was added, culminating with the story of the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i> one hundred years after the Buddha’s death.</p>
<p>This brings us to the interesting question of when the Khandhakas, and also the Sutta-vibhaṅga, were closed to new material. One of the issues we have not explained satisfactorily is the considerable sectarian differences between the Vinayas of the various schools. The emergence of separate schools only started around the time of Ashoka, maybe 150–200 years after the Buddha. It would seem, then, that we need to assume that changes were made to the Vinaya as long as 200–300 years after the Buddha.</p>
<p>Perhaps, but not necessarily so. The Sangha was spreading out over significant parts of India already during the lifetime of the Buddha. By the time of the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>, the Sangha had spread over a large geographical area. We know this from the geographical information given in Kd 22 and elsewhere.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-16' id='introduction-noteref-16' role='doc-noteref'>16</a> It would have been a difficult or even impossible task to efficiently disseminate new rules and regulations over such a large area. At the same time, it is likely that the Sangha was already splitting into groups. We see in Kd 22 that some monks were apparently following the Vinaya regulations closely, whereas others less so. We can surmise that differences in the interpretation of the Suttas would have created similar divisions. There were no doubt groups forming around charismatic teachers, an early example of which might be the monk Purāṇa of Kd 21 who refused to accept the authority of the Suttas and Vinaya as recited at the first <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>. Finally, we have the brute fact of physical distances which would have complicated the spreading of new material further.</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, it seems likely to me that proto-schools started to form long before Ashoka and probably soon after the Buddha’s passing. With the arising of different group identities, it would no longer be natural to uncritically receive updates to the Vinaya, or indeed to the Suttas, from a group with another identity. If a rule was regarded as coming from the Buddha, everyone would presumably embrace it, but not so if its origin lay elsewhere. The literature would have started to diverge. When independent schools arose properly in the post-Ashokan period, some would have inherited one version of this Vinaya, whereas others would have inherited other versions. It is in this way, I propose, that the differences we now observe between the different schools started to take shape soon after the Buddha had passed away. It is conceivable, yet by no means certain, that the various Vinayas as we have them today, including the Khandhakas, were in large part fixed by the time of the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>.</p>
<h2 id="the-mnemonic-verses-of-the-khandhakas">The mnemonic verses of the Khandhakas</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Khandhakas probably developed over a long period of time, with the core of it being laid down by the Buddha and the final version coming into existence at the earliest at the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>. The mnemonic verses at the end of each chapter point to a similar conclusion. Let us take a closer look at their content.</p>
<p>In the Sutta-vibhaṅga and the four main Nikāyas, the mnemonic verses at the end of chapters, called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i>, serve merely as aids to memorization, giving a series of key words that relate to the content of the preceding material. With the Khandhakas, however, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> take on a new function. Apart from being aids to memory, they here incorporate verses that extol the Buddha and the Vinaya, and even speak of the process of composing the Khandhakas.</p>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddāna</i> to Kd 1 starts with a series of seven verses in praise of the Vinaya. Especially notable is the inclusion here of the Parivāra, a text that is clearly sectarian and peculiar to the Pali tradition. The Abhidhamma, which is also sectarian, is mentioned too. Then there is the claim that Buddhism, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sāsana</i>, remains so long as the Vinaya persists, even if the Suttas and the Abhidhamma are forgotten. These opening verses set the scene for the expounding of the mnemonic verses, whose purpose it is to preserve the Vinaya. It is also noteworthy that the text speaks of the Chapters <i translate='no' lang='pli'>and</i> the Monastic Law, apparently viewing them as separate entities. It seems possible that the Khandhakas for a long time were regarded as a separate class of literature before eventually being incorporated into the Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<p>The verses referred to above must have been added a long time after the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>, and probably after the Canon had arrived in Sri Lanka. The idea that the Vinaya is what matters for the persistence of Buddhism echoes a similar saying in the Vinaya commentary, the Samantapāsādikā, that “the Vinaya is called the life of the Buddha’s dispensation; while the Vinaya persists, so does Buddhism.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-17' id='introduction-noteref-17' role='doc-noteref'>17</a> This is pretty much the opposite of what we would expect. At MN 104 we see the Buddha not being concerned about a dispute about the Vinaya, whereas he considers a dispute about the Dhamma as potentially very destructive.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-18' id='introduction-noteref-18' role='doc-noteref'>18</a> The sentiment expressed in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddāna</i> aligns better with the commentaries than the Suttas, again suggesting a late composition.</p>
<p>We find similar issues in the summary verses of other <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i>. At Kd 15 it is said that “A well-trained expert in the Monastic Law … is a learned one worthy of homage.” At Kd 18, which is concerned with etiquette, we find the following: “If you do not fulfill the proper conduct … you are not released from suffering.” Whereas morality, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīla</i>, is normally said to be the foundation of the path, this is here replaced by etiquette. Both these examples show a similar bias toward the Vinaya as what we see in the commentaries, as referenced above.</p>
<p>The most obvious case of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> being late, however, is found in Kd 13. Here we find the following verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The teachers of analytical statements,<br>
Who are the inspiration of Sri Lanka,<br>
The residents of the Mahāvihāra Monastery—<br>
These were their words for the longevity of the true Teachings.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-19' id='introduction-noteref-19' role='doc-noteref'>19</a></p>

<p>Here there is no doubt that we are deeply into the sectarian period. Not only were the summary verses composed in Sri Lanka, but so, apparently, was much of Kd 13.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-20' id='introduction-noteref-20' role='doc-noteref'>20</a></p>
<p>Another point worthy of consideration is that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> themselves seem to suggest a process of gradual accretion, with no definitive cut-off point. The summary verses at Kd 1 say that “It’s hard to complete without remainder—you should know it from the method.” And at Kd 3 we find that “Because of the gaps in the summary of topics, one should attend carefully to the way of the passages of the Canonical text.” It is not quite clear why this is stated, but a reasonable suggestion is that material was accumulating even as the verses were composed. It follows that the verses themselves soon became outdated and inadequate.</p>
<p>As it happens, there are plenty of such “gaps” where the summary verses do not capture certain passages in the main text. Sometimes the summary verses are very detailed and capture every minor rule or regulation, as at the beginning of Kd 15 where every rule is listed in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddāna</i>. At other times, as we shall see, whole passages are omitted.</p>
<p>I have not done a systematic survey of these omissions, but I have noted a few obvious examples:</p>

</dl>
<p>It seems likely that these passages are missing because they were added after the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> were considered complete. It may have been difficult, for reasons of style and meter, to alter the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> with every addition of a new passage to the main text. It may also be that the use of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> slowly went out of fashion as the texts were written down. Regardless, this supports our contention that the Khandhakas were added to for a long time into the sectarian period, even after they had arrived in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>A final point from the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddānas</i> is the interesting fact that there is none for Kd 14. It is tempting to conclude that this <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> is therefore particularly late. It happens to be the case, however, that Kd 14 has parallels in all other schools for which we have an extant Vinaya. This suggests that Kd 14 is not particularly late, especially since Kd 13, which we have shown as being late, does have summary verses. The absence of verses in Kd 14 requires a different explanation, a matter we shall return to when we discuss this chapter in the introduction to volume 5.</p>
<p>In sum, the mnemonic verses suggest that the Khandhakas were finalized in the sectarian period proper. This does not mean that most of their content comes from this period. Rather, I think there are good grounds for believing, based on the overall correspondence between the early schools,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-24' id='introduction-noteref-24' role='doc-noteref'>24</a> that the main content of the Khandhakas was fixed already at the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the content of each of the first ten <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i> in turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-great-chapter-mahā-khandhaka-kd-1">The Great Chapter, Mahā-khandhaka, Kd 1</h2>
<p>The Mahā-khandhaka, Kd 1, is the longest chapter of the Khandhakas. It is chiefly concerned with ordination. In other schools of Buddhism, it is called “the Account of Going Forth”, Pravrajyā-vastu, or its equivalent in Chinese and Tibetan.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-25' id='introduction-noteref-25' role='doc-noteref'>25</a> This chapter presumably comes first in the collection because ordination is the most basic of all Buddhist ceremonies in the sense that the Sangha could not exist without it.</p>
<p>Kd 1 begins with the biography of the Buddha, starting immediately after his awakening. After reflecting on his discovery, Kd 1 shows the Buddha meeting various beings, among them the two merchants Tapussa and Bhallika who become his first lay followers. The text turns to the famous request by Brahma Sahampati to teach the Dhamma and the Buddha’s response that “the doors to the freedom from death are open”. We then have the same narrative sequence as found in MN 26, “the Noble Search”, followed by the full version of the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-26' id='introduction-noteref-26' role='doc-noteref'>26</a> at the end of which Koṇḍañña becomes a stream-enterer. Then comes the ordination of the group of five monks through the earliest ordination procedure, the so-called “come, monk” formula,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-27' id='introduction-noteref-27' role='doc-noteref'>27</a> followed by the Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-28' id='introduction-noteref-28' role='doc-noteref'>28</a> at the end of which all five achieve perfection, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahantship</i>. We see that the narrative in Kd 1 is more complete and continuous than anything we find in the Suttas. We are dealing with a new sort of Buddha biography, which fills in gaps and adds details not found anywhere else.</p>
<p>The narrative continues with the story of the young man Yasa, whose going forth is partly modelled on that of the Buddha-to-be, but adding a number of supernormal events. Such additions deviate from the down-to-earth accounts found in the Suttas,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-29' id='introduction-noteref-29' role='doc-noteref'>29</a> and are akin to later Buddha biographies,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-30' id='introduction-noteref-30' role='doc-noteref'>30</a> which take this tendency even further. Examples from the current narrative include gates being opened by spirits and the Buddha making Yasa invisible to his own father. There is a sense that history is turning into myth.</p>
<p>The Sangha gradually grows until we reach a well-known passage where the Buddha tells his monks to go wandering to spread his teaching. This has sometimes been taken to mean that Buddhism is a missionary religion. Of course, the Buddha knew he had an important message for the world, a message that would benefit humanity. Yet proselytizing does not have the central role in the Dhamma that it has in other religions, such a Christianity. One reason for this is that Buddhism is not about conversion as such, but about sustained practice, which means that understanding the teaching and following up with study and reflection are fundamental to make it work. Buddhism is more about making the teaching available to anyone interested than it is about actively seeking converts. This is reflected in the way the Buddha teaches. People generally approach him to hear what he has to say, not the other way around.</p>
<p>A natural consequence of the monks spreading out over a larger geographical area was a dispersed demand for ordination. It became impractical for the Buddha to ordain all aspirants. The Buddha then lays down a new ordination formula, by way of taking the three refuges, and allows the monks to perform ordinations.</p>
<p>Although the threefold formula of going for refuge at some point becomes the standard way of declaring yourself a lay follower of the Buddha, it is found only rarely in the Tipiṭaka, and is entirely missing from the four main Nikāyas.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-31' id='introduction-noteref-31' role='doc-noteref'>31</a> It is possible, then, that since this formula was initially an ordination ceremony for monks, it was considered unsuitable for lay people. Only when the ordination ceremony evolved further, did the triple refuge become freed up for use by lay people. As it happens, we see that it becomes much more common in later Pali literature, especially the commentaries. In the Suttas and Vinaya the lay people use a related but simpler formula: “I go for refuge to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhagavā</i> (or “Sir Gotama”), and the Teaching, and the community of monks.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-32' id='introduction-noteref-32' role='doc-noteref'>32</a></p>
<p>Next, we find several conversion accounts, the longest of which tells the story of how the Buddha persuaded one thousand fire worshippers to become his followers. Again, we see the tendency of mythologizing the life of the Buddha. These stories are full of wonders, psychic powers, and improbable events, setting them apart from the more grounded autobiographical material of the four main Nikāyas.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-33' id='introduction-noteref-33' role='doc-noteref'>33</a> The story ends with the Buddha giving the well-known Fire Discourse, at the end of which all the one thousand ascetics reach full awakening.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-34' id='introduction-noteref-34' role='doc-noteref'>34</a></p>
<p>Another of these conversion accounts concerns King Bimbisāra of Magadha, the kingdom that was the precursor to King Ashoka’s empire a couple of centuries later. According to the Pabbajjā Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.1/en/sujato">Snp 3.1</a>, Bimbisāra had met the Buddha before his awakening, which may explain the king’s eagerness to see him again. The Buddha gives the king a teaching, upon which he becomes a stream-enterer together with 110,000 brahmin householders. The mythologizing tendency is once again on display.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite the prominence of King Bimbisāra in the consciousness of many Buddhists, he is a marginal figure in the four main Nikāyas, only mentioned in five separate <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i>, and he is never personally present in the narrated events. In DN 4 and 5, he is talked about in the third person as someone who respects certain brahmins, as a consequence of which he has granted them land (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#5.17">DN 4:5.17</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#6.17">DN 5:6.17</a>). In DN  18, he has already passed away (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn18/en/sujato#4.12">DN 18:4.12</a>). In MN 14 and 86, he is again spoken of in the third person (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#20.2">MN 14:20.2</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato#9.4">MN 86:9.4</a>). Already in the Suttas, Bimbisāra has a certain mythical quality to him. He becomes the legendary ideal king against whom other kings, especially his own son Ajātasattu, are measured. I believe there are good grounds to doubt whether the story of his meeting with the Buddha is authentic.</p>
<p>However this may be, the story continues with Bimbisāra giving his Bamboo Grove park, situated just outside of Rājagaha, to the Sangha. As part of the dedication, he pours water from a golden ceremonial vessel, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhiṅkāra</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-35' id='introduction-noteref-35' role='doc-noteref'>35</a> This was presumably an ancient Indian custom,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-36' id='introduction-noteref-36' role='doc-noteref'>36</a> which you will see performed to the present day in Buddhist monasteries around the world. A remarkably large part of present-day Buddhist culture has its source in the Suttas and the Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<p>The account of King Bimbisāra is followed by a final and most consequential conversion story, namely that of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. One morning Sāriputta observes Assaji, one of the first five monks, walking for alms. He is inspired by his demeanor and asks him who his teacher is. Assaji replies that it is the Buddha and then gives Sāriputta the following brief teaching:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Of causally arisen things,<br>
The Buddha has declared their cause,<br>
As well as their ending.<br>
This is the teaching of the Great Ascetic.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-37' id='introduction-noteref-37' role='doc-noteref'>37</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sāriputta immediately becomes a stream-enterer, as does his friend Moggallāna when he is told soon afterwards. They go to the Buddha who gives them the full ordination, declaring that they will become his chief disciples. This concludes most of the biographical narrative of this chapter.</p>
<p>Kd 1 continues with a detailed discussion of the proper relationship between teachers and students.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-38' id='introduction-noteref-38' role='doc-noteref'>38</a> To ensure that newly ordained monastics get proper training, the Buddha lays down the role of the preceptor, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upajjhāya</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.6.2">Kd 1:25.6.2</a>). The preceptor is named during the ordination ceremony (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#76.7.17">Kd 1:76.7.17</a>). The newly ordained monastic must then live supported by their preceptor or another teacher for five years in the case of monks and for two years in the case of nuns.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-39' id='introduction-noteref-39' role='doc-noteref'>39</a> It is a relationship where compassion should be the focus, not severity of discipline. The teacher should look upon their student as their son or daughter, and a student upon their teacher as their father or mother (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.6.3">Kd 1:25.6.3</a>). Many of the details of proper conduct given in this section are still normative for how good monastics behave in the present day.</p>
<p>The relationship between teacher and student is surprisingly two-sided. As one would expect, the preceptor should guide the student if the student loses their way. But the reverse is also true. If the preceptor speaks in a way that borders on an offense, the student should stop them (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.10.3">Kd 1:25.10.3</a>). If the preceptor becomes discontent with the spiritual life, becomes anxious,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-40' id='introduction-noteref-40' role='doc-noteref'>40</a> has wrong view, or has committed a serious offense, the student should help them out of their predicament (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.20.1">Kd 1:25.20.1</a>–25.22.4). Ideally the preceptor should be an inspiring role model for his or her students. Reality, unfortunately, does not always measure up to such ideals.</p>
<p>The discussion on teachers and students continues with the issue of wrong conduct, especially on the part of the student. The student should ask for forgiveness and the teacher should grant it, not doing either of which is an offense of wrong conduct (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#27.3.1">Kd 1:27.3.1</a>–27.4.8). We then come to a list of five qualities that a good student should have in regard to his or her teacher: affection, confidence, conscience, and respect, and their mind should develop under the guidance of their teacher (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#27.6.4">Kd 1:27.6.4</a>).</p>
<p>Among a large number of origin stories for various rules, Kd 1 tells the touching account of a brahmin who wishes to ordain, but who is rejected by the Sangha. The Buddha then asks if anyone can remember any good actions of that brahmin, in response to which Sāriputta says that he recalls him giving a ladleful of food. The Buddha tells Sāriputta to ordain him. When Sāriputta asks the Buddha how, the Buddha lays down a new ordination procedure, which constitutes the core of the one we still use in the present day. It is performed by the Sangha through a legal procedure of one motion and three announcements, a so-called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. I will look at <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> in more detail when I discuss Kd 9 below.</p>
<p>Many more rules concerned with ordination are laid down in the remainder of Kd 1. Many of these have the effect of expanding the ordination ceremony further,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-41' id='introduction-noteref-41' role='doc-noteref'>41</a> until it reaches its final form toward the end of the chapter (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#76.5.6">Kd 1:76.5.6</a>–76.12.17). Apart from the rules that directly relate to the ordination ceremony, there are other rules that concern ordination in a broader sense. There is a section that lists the qualities required of one who wishes to give ordinations (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#36.2.1">Kd 1:36.2.1</a>–37.14.2). Then there are rules on the ordination and training of novices (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#50.1.1">Kd 1:50.1.1</a>–52.1.8 and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#54.1.1">Kd 1:54.1.1</a>–60.1.15), and a discussion on the ordination of monastics of other religions (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#38.1.1">Kd 1:38.1.1</a>–38.11.7). The latter need to be on probation for four months to show that their true faith lies with the Buddha. We see this requirement mentioned quite regularly in the Suttas.</p>
<p>Kd 1 also contains rules on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaya</i>, often rendered as “dependence”, but here given as “formal support” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#35.1.1">Kd 1:35.1.1</a>–36.1.7, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#53.4.2.1">Kd 1:53.4.2.1</a>–53.13.5, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#72.1.1">Kd 1:72.1.1</a>–73.4.9). <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nissaya</i> concerns the relationship between teacher and student. The basic idea is that a newly ordained monk should stay with his teacher for a minimum of five years or until he is sufficiently knowledgeable to live independently, whichever is the longest. There are many more rules, mostly minor, that I will not discuss here.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-the-observance-day-uposatha-kkhandhaka-kd-2">The Chapter on the Observance Day, Uposatha-kkhandhaka, Kd 2</h2>
<p>The chapter on the observance day, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, is a natural continuation of the chapter on ordination. Once the Sangha had come into existence, it would have required certain basic functions to make it a cohesive entity. The most fundamental of these functions is the half-monthly observance day when the Sangha meets to give Dhamma talks and recite the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>The origin story to this chapter points to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> being an ancient religious observance that goes back to the time before the Buddha. It was held on the full moon, the new moon, and the quarter moons. The monastics of the various religions would gather and give teachings, thus creating a following among householders.</p>
<p>The Buddha often adopted the customs of contemporary society. As we shall see in the next chapter, he accepted the established practice of staying put during the rainy season. He took on practices such as putting one’s palms together as a sign of respect, known as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>añjali</i>, and bowing. He had his monastics wear robes that were hardly distinguishable from the robes of monastics of other religions.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-42' id='introduction-noteref-42' role='doc-noteref'>42</a> Most important of all, he often adopted the religious vocabulary of the time, keeping much of the existing meaning while often adding a slant of his own.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-43' id='introduction-noteref-43' role='doc-noteref'>43</a> The Buddha was a pragmatist. Although the essence of his message was revolutionary, he only broke with convention when necessary.</p>
<p>When the Buddha lays down that the Pātimokkha should be recited on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, he provides a preamble, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nidāna</i>, to the recitation of the rules (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#3.2.4">Kd 2:3.2.4</a>). This is followed by a word commentary, the only such commentary in the Khandhakas (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#3.4.1">Kd 2:3.4.1</a>–3.8.7). Neither the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nidāna</i> nor the word commentary is found in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, where it would seem to belong. Instead, it is part of the Pātimokkha as preserved in commentaries.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-44' id='introduction-noteref-44' role='doc-noteref'>44</a> It seems likely to me that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nidāna</i> together with its commentary originally found its home in the Sutta-vibhaṅga, but was moved to the Khandhakas once these had been created. We see the same process at play that we have discussed above with reference to the seven principles for settling legal issues.</p>
<p>The purpose of the recitation the Pātimokkha is to remind the monks and the nuns of the rules they are meant to follow. To emphasize this point, the Buddha lays down a rule that one should not listen to the Pātimokkha with unconfessed offenses, followed by a confession formula (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#27.1.3">Kd 2:27.1.3</a>). The question sometimes arises of which offenses one needs to confess: the Pātimokkha offenses or all offenses laid down in the Vinaya Piṭaka? On the answer to this question hinges the important principle of how the confession is to be done. There are so many offenses in the Vinaya as a whole that it is impossible to remember them all. From this arises the modern habit of doing general confessions of entire classes of offenses, just in case one has forgotten an offense.</p>
<p>Yet general confessions are a problem. Part of the confession formula is to undertake restraint for the future, which is impossible if one does a general confession. One needs to be clear about which offense one has committed to be able to take on restraint. And so the confession formula degenerates into a ritual, its original purpose no longer fulfilled.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have good indications that only the Pātimokkha offenses need to be confessed.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-45' id='introduction-noteref-45' role='doc-noteref'>45</a> For instance, we encounter a monk who remembers an offense while listening to the Pātimokkha, presumably because he has just been reminded (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#27.4.1">Kd 2:27.4.1</a>). Moreover, we know from <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4/en/brahmali#244">AN 4.244</a> that in the earliest period there were only four classes of offenses, that is, the main offenses of the Pātimokkha, excluding the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiyas</i>. The introduction to Kd 2 speaks of five or seven classes of offenses, which is curious given that the five are included in the seven. It seems likely that five is the earlier reading, with the seven added at some point. The five would have been the four classes mentioned at AN 4.244, plus the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkata</i> offenses in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules, and so we are again limited to the Pātimokkha offenses. Then there is <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/brahmali#1.20.1">Bu Pc 72</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc73/en/brahmali#1.15.1">Bu Pc 73</a>, both of which concern monks who become aware, or pretend to become aware, of an offense as they hear it mentioned during the Pātimokkha recitation. There is nothing about offenses outside the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p>Moreover, as we have seen, monks sometimes remembered offenses during the Pātimokkha recitation, in which case they did the confession after the recitation (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#27.5.1">Kd 2:27.5.1</a>). Had they done a general confession beforehand, this would not be required, and so it is clear that the monastics did not do general confessions at this time. If they had forgotten an offense, they would presumably either not confess it at all or wait until they remembered it. On top of this, we have the fact that the name of the offense is always specified in the confession formulas given in the Vinaya Piṭaka.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-46' id='introduction-noteref-46' role='doc-noteref'>46</a> I conclude that confession is about the clearing of specific offenses, and not a generalized ritual.</p>
<p>We now come to Monastery zones, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmās</i>, another fundamental Vinaya topic discussed in this chapter (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#6.1.1">Kd 2:6.1.1</a>–7.2.6). Once the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony is laid down, the Sangha needs to know who should attend. As the monastics gradually disperse over a large area, it becomes impossible to assemble them all for the twice-monthly recitation of the Pātimokkha. The Buddha then lays down the creation of monastery zones, areas within which all monastics must come together to perform the observance-day ceremony or to carry out other official Sangha business. The number of rules concerned with monastery zones in the Vinaya Piṭaka is relatively small, but in later Pali literature this becomes a major issue, with entire tracts dedicated to the analysis of a variety of mostly marginal circumstances.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-47' id='introduction-noteref-47' role='doc-noteref'>47</a></p>
<p>It soon became necessary to build observance-day halls (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#8.1.1">Kd 2:8.1.1</a>–8.4.11). It seems reasonable to infer that monasteries would have developed around such core infrastructure. In later <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i>, especially Kd 16, we shall see how a variety of buildings are allowed by the Buddha, presumably leading to quite extensive monastic institutions. While the early ideal of the independent monastic no doubt still existed, a significant portion of the monastic community would have settled within highly developed monasteries. This is to be expected. As Buddhism attracted an ever-greater number of monastics, only a decreasing proportion would have been able to cope with the solitude and simplicity of a more independent lifestyle.</p>
<p>Most of the remainder of Kd 2 concerns details of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony. As part of this, there is a brief discussion of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, the legal procedures of the Sangha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#16.4.1">Kd 2:16.4.1</a>–16.5.9). According to the Parivāra, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony is a kind of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-48' id='introduction-noteref-48' role='doc-noteref'>48</a> In the rest of the Vinaya, however, it seems to be regarded as separate from <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. In a number of places, we find <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, and often <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> (“invitation”) as well, listed as separate items, indicating that they were not regarded as equivalent.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-49' id='introduction-noteref-49' role='doc-noteref'>49</a> I conclude that, in the earliest period, neither the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony nor the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> ceremony were regarded as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i> proper. This is an interesting point which I will return to when I discuss <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> in greater detail in relation to Kd 9 below.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is clear that many of the rules that govern <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> are binding on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony, including the requirement that the assembly be complete (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#23.1.1">Kd 2:23.1.1</a>–24.3.14 and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#28.1.1">Kd 2:28.1.1</a>–34.13.5). Because these rules are the same for the two circumstances, and because the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony is described in greater detail than the exposition of any specific <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, it seems reasonable to take the rules for the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony as normative for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. This matters, as I will now show.</p>
<p>The validity of ordinations is a perennial issue, often discussed in monastic circles. In brief, the question is how we can know the validity of all ordinations going all the way back to the time of the Buddha. The straightforward answer is that this is impossible. There are many ways in which <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i> fail, any of which would invalidate an ordination.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-50' id='introduction-noteref-50' role='doc-noteref'>50</a> Given the history of the Sangha and its periodic corruption, one could then reasonably doubt whether the current crop of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i> are real monastics.</p>
<p>It is in this context that the following passage is particularly interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“On the observance day, four or more resident monks may have gathered together in a certain monastery. They don’t know there are other resident monks who haven’t arrived. Perceiving that they’re acting according to the Teaching and the Monastic Law, perceiving that the assembly is complete although it’s not, they do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code. When they’ve just finished, and the entire gathering has left, a smaller number of resident monks arrive. In such a case, what has been recited is valid, and the late arrivals should announce their purity in the presence of the others. There’s no offense for the reciters.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#28.7.15">Kd 2:28.7.15</a>–28.7.21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony has been performed with an incomplete assembly. Had they known that the assembly was incomplete, the ceremony would have been invalid and the monks would have committed an offense, as the subsequent section makes clear. But because they perceive the assembly as complete, the ceremony is valid and there is no offense for the monks taking part. The important point here is that it is their <i translate='no' lang='pli'>perception</i> that matters. That is, if they perceive the assembly as complete, then for all practical purposes it is complete.</p>
<p>This is different from how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is generally understood. Most monastics will assume that an ordination is invalid if a monastic happens to pass through the monastery zone while the ordination is being performed.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-51' id='introduction-noteref-51' role='doc-noteref'>51</a> This passage proves the opposite. Yet one of the drivers of the tradition of creating small monastery zones known as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khaṇḍa-sīmās</i>, often within the walls of a building, is precisely to avoid anyone entering the zone while a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is carried out. But given this passage in Kd 2, this seems unnecessary. Worse, the whole tradition of small monastery zones voids the purpose of such zones, which is to ensure that the whole monastic community is present when important decisions are made. With a proper monastery zone that extends over an entire monastery, all the residents must be present for the decision to be valid. With a small monastery zone, any group of four monastics can make whatever decision they wish without consultation. The democratic system of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> effectively breaks down.</p>
<p>If, however, as suggested in Kd 2, perception is a factor in determining the validity of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, there are two important benefits. First, so long as you are not aware of any specific ordination in the past that was invalid, you can conclude that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhus</i> today are monks in the true sense of the word.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-52' id='introduction-noteref-52' role='doc-noteref'>52</a> Second, there is no longer any good reason to create small monastery zones. In fact, to ensure that monastery zones fulfill their original purpose, it would make sense to return to the ancient practice of creating monastery zones that cover meaningful areas, such as complete monasteries.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-entering-the-rainy-season-residence-vassūpanāyika-kkhandhaka-kd-3">The Chapter on Entering the Rainy-season Residence, Vassūpanāyika-kkhandhaka, Kd 3</h2>
<p>Kd 3 concerns the annual three-month rainy-season residence, which is compulsory for all monastics. During this period, which coincides with the Indian monsoon season, monastics must stay put in one place. According to Kd 3, this is because travel would result in the destruction of life, but presumably it was also because travel was difficult and even hazardous at this time. Interestingly, it seems householders too would sometimes stay put during the rainy season (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.13/en/sujato#2.1">AN 11.13:2.1</a>).</p>
<p>As with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, the Buddha adopted this tradition from the preexisting norms for monastics. As such, it is reasonable to think that this was instituted soon after the Sangha reached a certain size, probably quite early in the Buddha’s teaching career. The placement of this chapter immediately after the chapter on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> is thus natural and may reflect the chronological sequence in which these things were laid down. The sequence of the first four chapters of the Khandhakas is in fact the same for all early schools except the Mahāsaṅghikas, who reorganized their Khandhakas (known as Pakiṇṇakas) away from the general structure used by the other schools.</p>
<p>Most rules in this chapter are directly related to the rainy-season residence. To begin with, monastics are allowed to travel for seven days if there is important business to be undertaken, such as looking after a sick monastic or a family member (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#5.1.1">Kd 3:5.1.1</a>–8.1.7). Then follows a section which lays down that the place of residence must be properly covered—and have a door, says the commentary<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-53' id='introduction-noteref-53' role='doc-noteref'>53</a>—of which a simple hut, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuṭi</i>, would presumably be the most obvious choice (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#12.1.1">Kd 3:12.1.1</a>–12.9.6). Again, we see that a settled form of Buddhism must have existed virtually from the beginning.</p>
<p>This chapter appears to allow a monastic to spend the rainy season in more than one place, a fact that is rarely commented on. The monk Upananda is shown to spend the rainy season in two different monasteries, but is neither penalized nor criticized for this (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#14.1.1">Kd 3:14.1.1</a>). In the Chapter on Robes, we even find the Buddha laying down a rule on the appropriate distribution of cloth for monastics who spend the rains in two different monasteries (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#25.4.1">Kd 8:25.4.1</a>). This makes it clear that such an arrangement was considered acceptable.</p>
<p>Tangentially to the main content, monastics are told to comply with “the wishes of kings”.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-54' id='introduction-noteref-54' role='doc-noteref'>54</a> One implication of this is presumably that laws laid down by kings must be adhered to. And so, despite occasional indications to the contrary,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-55' id='introduction-noteref-55' role='doc-noteref'>55</a> it seems monastics too are bound by the law of the land.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-the-invitation-ceremony-pavāraṇā-kkhandhaka-kd-4">The Chapter on the Invitation Ceremony, Pavāraṇā-kkhandhaka, Kd 4</h2>
<p>This chapter lays down an annual invitation ceremony at which monks and nuns invite admonition from their fellow monastics. This happens at the end of the rainy-season residence, at which point most monastics will have spent three months living in the company of co-monastics, which would put them in a good position to give constructive feedback. According to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dhp76%E2%80%9389/en/brahmali#1">Dhp 76</a>, the pointing out of real flaws in one’s character is equivalent to the revealing of a treasure. Again, with the invitation ceremony coming straight after the chapter on the rainy-season residence, we see a natural chronological evolution of these rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Kd 4 begins with a story of monastics spending the three months of the rainy-season residence without talking to each other. Perhaps surprisingly, the Buddha admonishes them for this practice, calling it a living in discomfort, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aphāsuṁ vuṭṭhā</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali#1.12.2">Kd 4:1.12.2</a>). Right speech in the Dhamma is about saying what is necessary in the right way and at the right time, with an emphasis on being quiet, but taking a vow of silence is going too far.</p>
<p>As with the observance-day ceremony, the invitation ceremony does not seem to have been regarded as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> in the earliest period of Buddhism, for which see the discussion in Kd 2 above. Still, as with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony, the rules for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, especially those concerning legitimate assemblies, are applicable here too. A large part of this chapter is taken up with such rules.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-skins-camma-kkhandhaka-kd-5">The Chapter on Skins, Camma-kkhandhaka, Kd 5</h2>
<p>An important part of Kd 5 is its treatment of allowable and unallowable leather goods, hence its name. It also contains two interesting stories and a host of minor rules, many of which concern footwear.</p>
<p>Kd 5 begins with the story of Soṇa Koḷivisa who had been raised in such comfort that he had hairs growing on the soles of his feet.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-56' id='introduction-noteref-56' role='doc-noteref'>56</a> King Bimbisāra of Magadha demands to see this, and Soṇa is sent to meet the king. When the king has been duly satisfied, Soṇa joins a group of 80,000 village chiefs to see the Buddha. The Buddha’s attendant, Ven. Sāgata, displays numerous psychic powers, after which the Buddha teaches the Dhamma, leading all 80,000 to stream-entry. Soṇa, however, asks for the going forth.</p>
<p>After going forth, Soṇa exerts himself to such an extent that, according to the list of the Buddha’s most prominent disciples at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.198-208/en/sujato#an1.205_1.1">AN 1.205</a>, he is foremost in putting forth energy. Due to his sheltered upbringing, however, his feet are unable to cope with his long hours on the walking path. He sheds so much blood that the path looks “like a slaughterhouse”! When he thinks of returning to lay life, the Buddha visits him and teaches him the well-known simile of the lute: just as a lute is melodious only when the strings have the right tension, so the practice only ripens in good results when the energy has the right balance. Soṇa follows the Buddha’s instructions, eventually becoming an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arahant</i>. He declares his achievement to the Buddha with stirring words, concluding with a beautiful set of verses (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#1.20.1">Kd 5:1.20.1</a>–1.27.20). Then, as a rather abrupt anticlimax to a remarkable story, the Buddha lays down an allowance for monastics to use sandals.</p>
<p>After a number of further rules mostly concerned with footwear, we come to a prohibition against monastics using luxurious furniture, including beds (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#10.5.1">Kd 5:10.5.1</a>–10.5.3). Minor as it may seem, this rule fills an important gap in the Pātimokkha. Looking at the Pātimokkha in isolation, one might conclude that fully ordained monks do not need to keep all the precepts of a novice. Yet those of the ten precepts that are not found among the Pātimokkha rules are all covered in the Khandhakas. High and luxurious beds are prohibited here, whereas entertainment and personal beautification are banned at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#2.6.6">Kd 15:2.6.6</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#2.1.1">Kd 15:2.1.1</a>–2.5.11.</p>
<p>Kd 5 ends with the story of Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-57' id='introduction-noteref-57' role='doc-noteref'>57</a> at the end of which the Buddha loosens some of the Vinaya rules for areas beyond the Ganges plain. The story begins with Soṇa, who lives in a distant country, seeking ordination. But he is unable to obtain it because of the difficulty in assembling ten monks to perform the ceremony. He eventually gets ordained after waiting for three years. Soon, he decides to visit the Buddha. When he arrives, he is put up in the Buddha’s dwelling, a sign that he is regarded as special.</p>
<p>The following morning the Buddha asks him to recite Dhamma, upon which he chants the Chapter of Eights, the Aṭṭhakavagga, which is now included in the Sutta Nipāta. The Buddha praises him and then asks why it took him so long to get ordained. Seeing that there is a problem, the Buddha agrees to relax some of the rules for distant countries. Most importantly, he reduces the number of monastics required to perform an ordination ceremony from ten to five.</p>
<p>It is possible that the position of Kd 5 after the Chapter on the Invitation Ceremony is a result of this charming story. As the Sangha grew, it would have gradually spread out over a large area. The need to reform certain rules to accommodate this spread would no doubt have been felt from early on.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-medicines-bhesajja-kkhandhaka-kd-6">The Chapter on Medicines, Bhesajja-kkhandhaka, Kd 6</h2>
<p>The core concerns of Kd 6 are medicines and almsfood. These are two of the four requisites of a monastic, the other two being robes and dwellings. Robes are dealt with in Kd 8, whereas dwellings and other buildings feature in Kd 16. As we shall see, Kd 6 also contains many interesting and entertaining stories, featuring some of the most beloved characters from the Suttas.</p>
<p>The idea of medicines is quite broad in early Buddhism. It includes certain foodstuffs that can provide a boost of energy without being classed as substantial foods. Kd 6 opens with the Buddha allowing such “tonics” for sick monastics—even outside the regular meal time from dawn to noon. The discussion moves on to medicines proper, medical equipment, and medical treatments and procedures.</p>
<p>After an entertaining story with Ven. Pilindavaccha, which I will return to shortly, we find a series of rules on food. Noteworthy regulations include the prohibition against cooking (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#17.3.9">Kd 6:17.3.9</a>); the relaxation of certain rules at times of famine (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#17.7.1">Kd 6:17.7.1</a>–20.4.4); and, further on, the prohibition against human meat and the meat of animals considered noble, disgusting, or dangerous (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#23.1.1">Kd 6:23.1.1</a>–23.15.9).</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the stories, starting with the extraordinary Pilindavaccha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#15.1.1">Kd 6:15.1.1</a>–15.10.8). Pilindavaccha is building a shelter when King Bimbisāra offers to support him with monastery workers. Eventually there is a whole village with such workers, all closely affiliated with Pilindavaccha. One day when Pilindavaccha arrives at the house of a poor family, the daughter is crying because her parents cannot afford ornaments for her. Pilindavaccha uses his psychic powers to create a golden garland, upon which the whole family is arrested and charged with theft. Pilindavaccha goes to the king, turns his house into gold, and asks where he has gotten so much gold from. The king realizes that Pilindavaccha was using special powers all along, and he releases the family. The downside for Pilindavaccha is that he now becomes famous. He is given large amounts of tonics, to the point where the Buddha lays down a rule against storing tonics for more than seven days.</p>
<p>Pilindavaccha is also encountered at Bu Pj 2 where he saves two young boys from kidnappers, perhaps the earliest kidnapping story in the history of literature (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.47.1">Bu Pj 2:7.47.1</a>). Again, he uses psychic powers. Yet despite his special abilities, Pilindavaccha was also sickly, as can be seen from the early parts of Kd 6. Perhaps this combination of strength and vulnerability made him especially beloved. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.215/en/sujato">AN 1.215</a> he is said to be the Buddha’s foremost disciple in being dear to the gods.</p>
<p>Then there is the striking story of Suppiyā who has so much faith in the Sangha that she cuts a piece of meat from her own thigh to support a sick monk (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#23.1.4">Kd 6:23.1.4</a>–23.9.10). The Buddha uses his special powers to instantly heal her thigh. He then criticizes the monks for not being more circumspect in receiving offerings from lay supporters. The theme of the importance of sensitivity to lay supporters is continued in the story of the government minister with weak faith (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#25.1.1">Kd 6:25.1.1</a>–25.7.9). The minister invites a large sangha for a meal, but is hurt when the monks only eat a little. It turns out they have eaten elsewhere beforehand. The Buddha criticizes them and lays down a rule prohibiting such behavior.</p>
<p>The story of the General Sīha , also found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.12/en/sujato">AN 8.12</a>, tells of how he converted from Jainism after a meeting with the Buddha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#31.1.1">Kd 31.1.1</a>–31.14.6). The story ends with Sīha inviting the Buddha and the Sangha for a meal that includes meat, showing that the Buddha ate meat. Still, the Buddha lays down a rule that a monastic may only eat meat when they have no reason to believe that the animal was killed especially for them.</p>
<p>Another story concerns the remarkable layman Meṇḍaka (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#34.1.1">Kd 6:34.1.1</a>–34.16.3). He and many of his family members have supernormal powers, as does his slave. After a long story in which Meṇḍaka and his family show their powers to a government minister, Meṇḍaka becomes a follower of the Buddha. The Buddha grants Meṇḍaka his wish of supplying provisions for monastics who are traveling in the wilderness. He then lays down a rule that one may look for provisions before traveling in such places. He also lays down a rule that an attendant may keep money on behalf of a monastic. This allowance, known as the Meṇḍaka allowance, becomes the basis for <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali#1.3.1">Bu NP 10</a>, which explains the procedure for making use of such funds.</p>
<p>In most of these stories we see the prominent use of psychic powers. Again, this suggests that these stories are slightly later than the four main Nikāyas and the core material of the Vinaya Piṭaka. There are many more stories in this chapter, including the account of the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra and the account of Ambapālī offering her mango grove. These are essentially the same as the parallel versions found in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.19.1">DN 16:1.19.1</a>–2.3.10 and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.14.1">DN 16:2.14.1</a>–2.19.9). These remnants of DN 16 in Kd 6 could be a further indication that the whole Sutta originally was part of the Vinaya, as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Kd 6 ends with an important set of rules sometimes called “the four great standards”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>catumahāpadesa</i>, which essentially state that new circumstances are to be compared to existing ones and adjudicated according to the ones they resemble the most (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#40.1.4">Kd 6:40.1.4</a>). These rules are a response to the reality that it is impossible to cover all conceivable situations with a fixed set of rules. Moreover, such standards become particularly important after the Buddha’s passing and as society evolves in unpredictable ways. The Buddha makes it clear in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta that the monastics should not create new rules after he is gone (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#1.6.13">DN 16:1.6.13</a>). This regulation, then, is a way of creating the necessary flexibility in the Vinaya so that it can deal with new and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-the-robe-making-ceremony-kathina-kkhandhaka-kd-7">The Chapter on the Robe-making Ceremony, Kathina-kkhandhaka, Kd 7</h2>
<p>The robe-making ceremony was laid down to help monastics obtain new robes before they set out wandering at the end of the rainy-season residence. Having spent three months in one place, the monastics would have built up a relationship with the local lay Buddhists. The robe-making ceremony was an opportunity for the lay followers to express their gratitude by offering robe-cloth to the monastics.</p>
<p>In brief, this is how it works. The lay supporters designate a special cloth, which they give for the purpose of performing the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> ceremony. The Sangha decides on an individual monastic to receive the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> robe, which they then proceed to sew. When the robe is finished, it is given to the designated recipient, with everyone expressing their approval. All the monastics who take part in this process gain so-called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> privileges. The most important of these is that one may continue collecting robe-cloth until the end of the cold season, four months after the end of the rainy season. This is a significant extension on the normal ten-day limit for storing robe-cloth at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np1/en/brahmali#2.17.1">Bu NP 1</a>, giving the monastics involved a reasonable opportunity to collect enough cloth to make a robe. The remaining four privileges, which are set out at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/brahmali#1.3.2">Kd 7:1.3.2</a>–1.3.4, are concerned with making it easier for monastics to acquire robe-cloth.</p>
<p>The description of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> ceremony in Kd 7 is short and lacking in certain detail. According to Frauwallner, p. 185, “… the description of the Kathina procedure itself is so mutilated, that without comparing the other Vinaya it is impossible to get a clear idea of it.” To gain a full understanding of the process, it is necessary to consult the “Subdivision on the Robe-making Ceremony”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathinabheda</i>, in the Parivāra at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr16/en/brahmali">Pvr 16</a>. This is one of the few occasions where the Parivāra contains critical information for a proper understanding of the Vinaya.</p>
<p>The remainder of Kd 7 sets out a long permutation series on when the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> privileges come to an end. This, in turn, is summarized as the coming together of two factors: (1) one leaves the monastery at which one stayed for the rains residence with no intention to return; and (2) one either has made a robe or gives up one’s intention to make one (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/brahmali#13.1.1">Kd 7:13.1.1</a>–13.2.7).</p>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> ceremony is the last of the main Sangha procedures that all or most monastics are expected to take part in. There are further legal procedures laid down in the remaining <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhakas</i>, but they concern special circumstances.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-on-robes-cīvara-kkhandhaka-kd-8">The Chapter on Robes, Cīvara-kkhandhaka, Kd 8</h2>
<p>As we have seen, in Kd 6 the focus is on medicines and almsfood, whereas here the focus is on robes, the third of the four traditional requisites of a monastic. The fourth requisite, dwellings, is the subject of Kd 16. Apart from rules relating to robes, this chapter has three interesting and inspiring stories that enliven an otherwise dry exposition.</p>
<p>Monastic robes are heavily regulated. Allowable materials and colors are specified, as is the pattern into which the robe may be sewn (respectively at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#3.1.5">Kd 8:3.1.5</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#29.1.18">Kd 8:29.1.18</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#12.1.1">Kd 8:12.1.1</a>). The number of robes is restricted to three (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#13.5.8">Kd 8:13.5.8</a>). The common practice of keeping extra robes is only made possible by exploiting loopholes in the rules. The maximum size of the robes is not specified here but at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92/en/brahmali">Bu Pc 92</a>–9.4.4. There is even a correct procedure for the distribution of robe-cloth (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#9.1.1">Kd 8:9.1.1</a>–9.4.4).</p>
<p>As robe-cloth accrued to monasteries, the cloth needed to be received, stored, and distributed. This required Sangha officials to perform these functions. An important new regulation allows for the appointment of Sangha officials through a legal procedure, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, of one motion and one announcement (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#5.1.1">Kd 8:5.1.1</a>–6.2.12). This is important for at least two reasons. First, it shows that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is the primary tool of the Sangha for making all sorts of internal decisions. We shall see at Kd 21 that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is the appropriate mechanism whenever a decision is made that concerns the whole community. This contrasts with the modern tendency of decisions being made by abbots or sometimes groups of senior monastics. Second, it shows the importance of delegation in Sangha affairs. Instead of the whole Sangha being involved in minor decision making, any office or job can be delegated to individual monastics. This makes the running of a monastic community more efficient.</p>
<p>Apart from robes, many other cloth requisites are mentioned in this chapter. One of these is the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i>, “the sitting mat”, often rendered as “sitting cloth” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#16.1.1">Kd 8:16.1.1</a>–16.4.3). The latter rendering, however, seems to be a result of the current practice of using the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i> indoors as opposed to outdoors, which is how we see it used in the Suttas. I discuss the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i> further in Appendix I: Technical Terms.</p>
<p>The first of the three significant stories is that of Jīvaka, who becomes the Buddha’s personal physician (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#1.4.1">Kd 8:1.4.1</a>–1.34.14). Jīvaka is the unwanted child of a high-class sex worker. Soon after he is born, she puts him in a basket and has him thrown on a trash heap, where he was found and then brought up by King Bimbisāra’s son Prince Abhaya. Not being satisfied with the life of a royal, Jīvaka secretly departs for Takkasilā to become a physician. He studies for seven years. His final exam consists of traveling all around Takkasilā to a distance of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojana</i>—approximately 13 kilometers<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-58' id='introduction-noteref-58' role='doc-noteref'>58</a>—and bringing back any plant that is not medicinal. Jīvaka comes back empty handed, upon which he is declared fully educated. We have much to learn from the ancients in the art of conducting exams!</p>
<p>On his way back to Rājagaha, Jīvaka cures an apparently incurable wealthy lady and earns a fortune. Upon his return to Rājagaha, he cures King Bimbisāra of hemorrhoids. Next, he performs what may be the world’s first recorded brain surgery, during which he removes two insects from the brain of a wealthy merchant. Next up is the son of a wealthy merchant. Jīvaka ties him to a pillar, cuts open his belly, and then unravels his twisted gut. The most daring of Jīvaka’s medical adventures, however, was his cure of King Pajjota who was infamous for his hot temper. Jīvaka treats him with a medicine that does not agree with him, upon which the king unleashes his fearsome temper. When the king discovers that Jīvaka has already fled, he dispatches his best man to capture him, but Jīvaka cleverly escapes. Soon King Pajjota realizes he is cured. He sends two exquisite cloths to Jīvaka in gratitude, which Jīvaka gives to the Buddha. The Buddha uses the occasion to allow monastics to accept robes from householders. As a side issue, it is noteworthy that the Buddha does not just accept the cloths, granting himself a special exemption from the rules. Finally, Jīvaka becomes the Buddha’s doctor, and he also looks after the Sangha.</p>
<p>Where the story of Jīvaka is entertaining, the story of Visākhā is inspiring (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#15.1.1">Kd 8:15.1.1</a>–15.14.13). When Visākhā invites the Sangha headed by the Buddha for a meal, she learns that the monks are bathing naked in the rain. After serving the meal, she asks the Buddha to grant her a favor. The Buddha initially refuses, but she persists. She tells him that she wishes to give rainy-season bathing cloths to the monks. She also wants to give meals to newly arrived and departing monastics, to sick monastics and those who look after the sick, and more. The Buddha asks why he should grant her such a special privilege. She responds that she will get so much joy and happiness from this that she will gain <i translate='no' lang='pli'>samādhi</i> as a result. The Buddha is so impressed with her understanding of the Dhamma that he assents to what he normally would not.</p>
<p>In the final story, the Buddha himself is the focus (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#26.1.1">Kd 8:26.1.1</a>–26.4.14). While the Buddha is walking around the monastery, he comes across a monk who is suffering from dysentery, yet he has no nurse. The Buddha, together with Ānanda, cleans him up and lifts him onto a bed. The Buddha then admonishes the monks for not looking after the sick. He points out that there is no-one else to look after them. He then says that whoever would look after him, that is, the Buddha, should look after the sick.</p>
<p>It is easy to think of the Buddha as a rather distant and mystical figure who is above the fray. The reality, however, as we see here and elsewhere, is that the Buddha was very human in his interactions with the monks. By forgetting this side of the Buddha, we risk losing our connection to him. It is precisely because the Buddha was a human being that his teachings and example are so relevant. By noticing the little details in the Suttas and the Vinaya, we get a more realistic and down-to-earth appreciation of the Buddha as a historical personality.</p>
<p>This may be the right place to comment briefly on the occasional use of later vocabulary in the Khandhakas. In the story of Jīvaka we find the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>matthaluṅga</i>, “brain”, which is not encountered in the four main Nikāyas or the remainder of the Vinaya Piṭaka. In fact, in the four main Nikāyas, this word is conspicuously absent from the standard list of body parts used in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>asubha</i>, “ugliness”, contemplation, whereas it is included in the same list in later literature, such as the Khuddaka-pāṭha. As a rule, the presence or prevalence of certain vocabulary is a good way to establish the relative age of Pali literature. Much good research is waiting to be done in this area.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-connected-with-campā-campeyya-kkhandhaka-kd-9">The Chapter Connected with Campā, Campeyya-kkhandhaka, Kd 9</h2>
<p>Kd 9 is about <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, “the legal procedures of the Sangha”. We have seen how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is used for Sangha decision making to make the process democratic and transparent. For such decisions to have proper authority, however, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> needs to be clearly defined. The main purpose of this chapter, then, is to set out what constitutes valid and invalid <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. As such, it is quite technical in nature.</p>
<p>The chapter begins with the story of the monk Kassapagotta who is wrongly ejected from the Sangha by a group of visiting monks. This spurs the Buddha to lay down rules for the proper execution of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>.</p>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is valid only when:</p>
<ol>
<li>The assembly is complete (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#3.6.2">Kd 9:3.6.2</a>–3.6.3). This means that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is valid only if:
<ul>
<li>All monks/nuns within the monastery zone (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>) are present at the meeting</li>
<li>Anyone who is not present, for whatever reason, has sent their consent</li>
<li>No-one present objects to the decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The quorum requirement is met. Most <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i> require a quorum of four monastics. Some important <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakammas</i> require a quorum of five, ten, or twenty monastics (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#4.1.1">Kd 9:4.1.1</a>–4.1.10).</li>
<li>The object is valid, which means that:
<ul>
<li>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> must be done against a maximum of three monastics at a time (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#2.3.18">Kd 9:2.3.18</a>)</li>
<li>If the object is a person, they must generally be present for the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> to be valid (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali#1.1.18">Kd 14:1.1.18</a>–1.1.20)</li>
<li>The object toward which the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is directed must meet the requirements laid down in the Vinaya Piṭaka. For instance, a man receiving ordination must be twenty years old. If he is less, the ordination is invalid (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali#1.53.1">Bu Pc 65:1.53.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proclamation is performed correctly. This means that:
<ul>
<li>There must be one motion and either one or three announcements (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#3.3.3">Kd 9:3.3.3</a>–3.4.9)<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-59' id='introduction-noteref-59' role='doc-noteref'>59</a></li>
<li>The motion and the announcements must be in the right order (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali#3.9.2">Kd 9:3.9.2</a>–3.9.3)</li>
<li>The Parivāra adds that the wording must include certain critical elements (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr21/en/brahmali#3.1">Pvr 21:3.1</a>–4.3).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have not yet discussed the four kinds of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> occasionally mentioned in the Vinaya Piṭaka. Remarkably, the current chapter only mentions two of the four, that is, legal procedures consisting of one motion and one announcement and legal procedures consisting of one motion and three announcements. Kd 9 does not mention legal procedures consisting of one motion or legal procedures consisting of getting permission. Given that Kd 9 is the main exposition of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> in the Vinaya Piṭaka, how can this be?</p>
<p>It turns out that the two legal procedures not mentioned in Kd 9 are only rarely encountered anywhere in the Vinaya Piṭaka. They are found in the word commentary to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc79/en/brahmali#2.1.6">Bu Pc 79</a>, and five times in the Samatha-kkhandhaka, “The chapter on the settling of legal issues” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali#14.2.15">Kd 14:14.2.15</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali#14.11.5">Kd 14:14.11.5</a>–14.11.13, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali#14.15.4">Kd 14:14.15.4</a>). All these instances can reasonably be considered late in the evolution of the Tipiṭaka.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-60' id='introduction-noteref-60' role='doc-noteref'>60</a></p>
<p>As we have seen above in the discussion to Kd 2, neither the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony nor the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> ceremony were regarded as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> proper in the earliest period. This makes sense if <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> was restricted to those legal procedures that had either one or three announcements. Neither the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony nor the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> ceremony has this structure, being limited to the equivalent of a motion. At some point it was decided that both the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> ceremony and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> ceremony were so similar to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> that they needed to be included in this category. This necessitated the creation of legal procedures with a single motion. The legal procedure consisting of getting permission would have come into being in a similar way. We are left with the impression that both these latter procedures did not exist in the earliest period and are late additions to the Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<p>This matters because it illuminates how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> should ideally be performed in the modern era. The question arises of what form a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> should take if the Sangha is making a decision for which there is no prescription in the Vinaya Piṭaka. In Kd 21 we find an example of such a legal procedure that is external to the Vinaya (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.4.1">Kd 21:1.4.1</a>–1.4.14). Soon after the Buddha’s passing, the Sangha needed to appoint 500 monks to take part in the Council at Rājagaha. This was done through a procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. This, arguably, sets a precedent for how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> should be performed in the absence of a prescribed formula. One motion and one announcement is the proper structure. A single motion or getting permission should not be used since they are unlikely to stem from the Buddha.</p>
<h2 id="the-chapter-connected-with-kosambī-kosambaka-kkhandhaka-kd-10">The Chapter Connected with Kosambī, Kosambaka-kkhandhaka, Kd 10</h2>
<p>Kd 10, the last chapter of the Mahāvagga, is concerned with disputes in the Sangha and their resolution. Disputes can potentially lead to schism, which the Buddha regarded as a very serious matter. But even if a dispute does not lead to schism, it can potentially have negative consequences. This is what the Buddha has to say at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato#5.8">MN 104:5.8</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ānanda, a dispute about livelihood or the monastic code is a minor matter. But should a dispute arise in the Sangha concerning the path or the practice, that would be for the detriment, suffering, and harm of the people, for the detriment and suffering of gods and humans.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kd 10 begins with the well-known story of the dispute at Kosambī. Part of this story is also told in MN 128 and in the Kosambiya Jātaka, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja428">Ja 428</a>, and MN 48, the Kosambiya Sutta, is based on the same incident. In addition, many of the verses spoken by the Buddha in connection with it are found in the Dhammapada at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dhp3/en/brahmali">Dhp 3</a>–6. One gets the impression that this event had a major impact on the Sangha.</p>
<p>The story begins with the Sangha disputing whether a certain monk has committed an offense. The Sangha decides to eject the monk concerned, but he still refuses to acknowledge any fault. Both sides of the conflict build up a group of supporters, causing the Sangha to split into factions. Eventually someone asks the Buddha to intervene, but to no avail. At this point the Buddha tells the story of Dīghāvu, bits of which are found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja371">Ja 371</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ja428">Ja 428</a>. After this long and beautiful tale on the power of forgiveness and gentleness, the Buddha asks his monks to act accordingly, but again they will not listen. At this point the Buddha realizes he can do no more. He recites a series of powerful verses in the midst of the Sangha, and then departs. These verses are among the most famous and beloved in Buddhism (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/brahmali#3.1.3">Kd 10:3.1.3</a>–3.1.43).</p>
<p>The Buddha walks to the village Bālakaloṇaka where he visits the monk Bhagu, before proceeding to the Eastern Bamboo Park where he meets the three monks Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimila. They are shining examples of how to live in harmony, and are clearly meant to provide an edifying contrast to the monks in Kosambī.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-61' id='introduction-noteref-61' role='doc-noteref'>61</a> The Buddha carries on to Pālileyyaka, where he stays in solitude, only attended on by an elephant. This is another famous story, much told in the Buddhist world. Versions of it are found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ud4.5/en/sujato">Ud 4.5</a> and in the commentary to the Dhammapada. In the latter version a monkey offers honey to the Buddha, because of which he gets so excited that he falls out of the tree, dies, and is reborn straight in the heaven of the thirty-three. The Buddha eventually leaves and goes to Sāvatthī. The entire story is narrated at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/brahmali#4.1.1">Kd 10:4.1.1</a>–5.1.3.</p>
<p>In the meantime, after pressure from the lay people, the monks at Kosambī have come to their senses. It is interesting to note in passing the potential power lay Buddhists have over monastics who misbehave. Given the number of scandals involving monastics in the Buddhist world, it is a power they probably should exercise more often.</p>
<p>In any case, the monks set out for Sāvatthī. The monk who was at the center of the dispute has realized he actually did commit an offense. He asks to be readmitted, which he is. The Sangha then does a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> to unify the community, a so-called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sāmaggi-uposatha</i>, followed by the recitation of the Monastic Code.</p>
<p>This long story forms the main content of this chapter. There are only a few mentions of rules and regulations. One of these is a list of eighteen grounds, all connected with the Dhamma and Vinaya, that form the basis of disputes. This ties this chapter to Kd 17, where schism in the Sangha is discussed in much more detail. I will return to this theme in the introduction to the Cullavagga in volume 5.</p>

In fact, it is interesting that in MN 104 these two principles are grouped together at the top of the list, whereas in the Pātimokkha they are separated.

<p>Alternatively, it may be that these processes were kept as separate “documents”, which then became the kernel around which the Khandhakas were formed.

(See, for instance, the Journal of the Pali Text Society, 1993, pp. 1–41.)

<p>It is possible that the connection between “resolution face-to-face” and “majority decision” was lost as a consequence of this expansion.

He then concludes as follows: “We can now sum up our results thus: The story of the death of the Buddha and the account of the two earliest councils formed originally one single narrative. This narrative, according to the evidence of the great majority of the sources, was a fixed component of the Vinaya. It belonged to the Vinaya already in its earliest form recognizable to us, and had its place at the end of the Skandhaka.” (p. 46) <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-13' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>

<p>There are occasional descriptions in the Suttas of the Buddha performing supernormal feats, but these tend to be later additions. For instance, at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2.13.1">DN 24:2.13.1</a> we find an example of the Buddha supposedly levitating, of which Analayo 2016, p. 12, concludes: “In sum, the departure by levitation reported in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pāṭika-sutta</i> and its <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dīrgha-āgama</i> parallel seems to be a later addition to the discourse.” In relation to fire “miracles” Analayo 2015, p. 33, has this to say: “The selected examples of fire miracles performed by the Buddha surveyed above seem to be for the most part identifiable as later developments, probably the result of literal interpretations of metaphorical usages of the fire motif attested in text and art.” <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-29' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>

Yet, as I have argued, this is not a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> in the ordinary sense and it better fits with the Khandhaka material. Bhante Sujato comments as follows on the wonders found in the Vinaya: “On one level, it’s obviously a co-opting of Brahmanical prestige.
